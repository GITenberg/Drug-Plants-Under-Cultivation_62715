<p>The market demand for many cultivated plant

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">I</span>NTEREST in the possibility of deriving profit from the growing
of drug plants is increasing yearly. The clearing of forests, the
extension of the areas of land under tillage, and the activities of drug
collectors threaten the extermination of a number of valuable native
drug plants. Annually, large sums of money are expended for crude
drugs imported from countries where they are grown under conditions
of soil and climate resembling those of many localities in
the United States. As a means of guaranteeing the future supply
of crude drugs and of lessening the dependence on importations,
attention is now being turned to the cultivation of drug plants with
a view to increasing domestic production.</p>

<p>The problems presented by the cultivation of drug plants are not
less difficult than those encountered in the production of many other
crops. Drug plants are subject to the same diseases and risks as
other crops and are similarly affected by variations in soil and climatic
conditions. They require a considerable outlay of labor, the
same as other crops, and likewise require intelligent care and handling.
They are subject to the same laws of supply and demand, and,
like other products, must conform to the consumer's fancy and to
definite trade requirements.</p>

<p>A number of common medicinal plants have long been cultivated
in gardens in this country, either as ornamentals or as a source of
herbs used in cookery and as domestic remedies. A few of these
plants, such as goldenseal, wormwood, wormseed, and peppermint,
have been grown commercially for sale as crude drugs; but the acreage
devoted to their production has been relatively small and for
the most part restricted to certain localities. Other drug plants
which occur as common weeds in many places may prove to respond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
to cultivation; experiments should then be undertaken to determine
whether it is profitable to grow them. In this connection it should
be remembered that the soil type very often is an important limiting
factor in propagating different kinds of plants. Some plants grow
best in well-drained loam, some prefer a marsh, some require soils
rich in lime, while others thrive only in acid soil. The soil requirements
of all plants are not understood; in fact it is not improbable
that better comprehension of the soil, climatic, and cultural conditions
adapted to the different kinds of plants will enable the successful
propagation of species now regarded as unsuited to cultivation.
In undertaking the growing of medicinal plants, therefore, it is
essential to know that the species selected for cultivation will do
well under the conditions of soil and climate existing where the
planting is to be made. When necessary, this should be determined
on small experimental plats before undertaking commercial plantings.</p>

<p>Assuming that the soil and climate of the situation selected are
suitable for the growing of drug plants, it does not necessarily follow
that they can be produced at a profit. The cost of production and
marketing may be greater than the amount received for the crop
when it is sold. Some drug plants not well suited for cultivation on
a large scale may be found profitable when grown on small areas as
a side line. On the other hand, some may be produced more cheaply
when cultivated on a scale large enough to warrant the use of labor-saving
devices than when grown on small areas with the aid of hand
labor alone. The value of land, the cost and availability of labor,
and the possible returns from other crops are all factors to be considered
carefully. On account of the variation in these factors according
to locality, the same crop might prove to be profitable in one
location and unprofitable in another. It is for these reasons that
unqualified statements concerning the ease and profitableness of drug
plant growing should not be taken too seriously.</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_DRUG_PLANTS_SUITABLE_FOR_CULTIVATION_IN" id="SOME_DRUG_PLANTS_SUITABLE_FOR_CULTIVATION_IN">SOME DRUG PLANTS SUITABLE FOR CULTIVATION IN
THE UNITED STATES.</a></h2>


<p>The number of drug plants which may be grown in the United
States is large, although the same plants are not equally adapted to
the conditions of soil and climate prevailing in different sections.
Often the most suitable plants for a particular locality can not be
foretold, especially in those situations where no attempts have yet
been made to grow them. In such cases it is well to select for cultivation
plants which thrive elsewhere under conditions most closely
resembling those of the new situation in which it is proposed to grow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span>
them. The success with which ordinary field or garden crops can
be grown will in general indicate the possible suitability of a given
location for growing many medicinal plants. Since a number of
native medicinal plants which in their wild state are restricted to
certain localities have been successfully cultivated in situations far
beyond their natural range, there are good reasons for believing that
many such plants will thrive in sections where they are not now
grown. However, good results can scarcely be expected unless the
plants are placed under conditions similar to those in which they
normally thrive.</p>

<p>In suitable soil and under favorable weather conditions the following
drug plants have been found to thrive well under cultivation in
numerous places in the Central and Eastern States and will probably
be found suitable for cultivation in many other situations if the
difference in climatic conditions is not too great:</p>

<p>The special details of cultivation for each of the medicinal plants
mentioned are given under the discussion of the individual species.
Suggestions which are of general application, however, are here
brought together, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>

<p><i>Propagation.</i>&mdash;A number of the species considered later can be
grown easily from seed, but others are best propagated from cuttings
or by division. Many wild medicinal plants are much more difficult
to propagate from seeds than the species commonly grown in gardens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
Likewise, some of the species now grown abroad and suitable for
cultivation in this country are not easily propagated and require
special conditions if good results are to be realized.</p>

<p>Seeds of the better-known varieties of medicinal plants are regularly
listed in the catalogues of numerous seed houses, and those
which are less common can usually be obtained from dealers who
make a specialty of one or more of these species. Plants can frequently
be obtained from nurseries or from dealers in hardy ornamentals.
The catalogues of a number of dealers should be consulted
and the varieties for propagation carefully selected. In ordering,
the medicinal variety should always be called for, since many of the
related ornamental forms which are listed are of doubtful, if any,
medicinal value.</p>

<p><i>Sowing the seed.</i>&mdash;A relatively small number of medicinal plants
can be satisfactorily grown from seed sown in the field. In many
cases this method is quite uncertain and with some plants wholly inadvisable.
In order to insure a good stand of thrifty plants it is
frequently necessary to make the sowings in a greenhouse, hotbed, or
coldframe and at a suitable time transplant the seedlings to the field.
Much information on seed germination, hotbeds, and coldframes can
be gained by consulting Farmers' Bulletins 934, 937, and 1044,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
entitled, respectively, "Home Gardening in the South," "The Farm
Garden, in the North," and "The City Home Garden."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

application to the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.</p></div>

<p>The preparation of the soil is of prime importance, whether the
sowing of the seed is made in the open or under cover. Many seeds,
especially those which are very small, do not germinate well in heavy
soils or in those which are cloddy and coarse in texture. A seed bed
prepared by thoroughly mixing equal parts of garden soil, leaf mold,
well-rotted manure, and clean sand will be suitable for the germination
of most seeds.</p>

<p>The depth of sowing is largely governed by the size of the seeds
and the character of the soil. In general, the smaller the seed the
less the depth of sowing. Seed should be covered more deeply in
light sandy soil than in heavy clay soil. Fall-sown seeds also require
a greater depth of covering than those sown in the spring. The
exact quantity of seed which should be used for sowing a given area
can not be definitely stated. The same kind of seed will be found
to vary widely in its power to germinate; hence, the percentage of
germination should be ascertained in advance of sowing and the
quantity regulated accordingly. In general, the heavier the soil the
larger the quantity of seed required. If the plants are to be thinned
out or transplanted, or if they are especially subject to the attacks
of insects, the free use of seed is usually advisable.</p>

<p>When plantings are made in open ground it is preferable to sow
the seed in rows or drills, in order that cultivation of the soil may
be possible. A shallow furrow may be opened with a rake or hand
hoe and the seed sown by hand. The rake or hoe may then be used
to cover the seed with the required depth of soil. It is much more
satisfactory to use seed drills, such as are commonly used by market
gardeners, than to sow by hand, since with the drill the depth of
sowing is more uniform and the soil is compacted over the seeds,
thus favoring good germination. The distance between the rows is
determined in part by the size which the plants attain at maturity,
but depends chiefly upon the method of cultivation to be used. A
spacing of 9 to 16 inches between the rows will readily permit hand
cultivation, but the rows should be about 3 feet apart if horse-drawn
implements are employed.</p>

<p><i>Cultivation.</i>&mdash;There are no set rules for the cultivation of medicinal
plants, and the grower's experience with other plants must be
relied upon as a guide in many of the details of cultivation. As a
general rule, the soil should be worked with the hoe or cultivator at
frequent intervals and kept free from weeds. It is a good practice
to cultivate after a hard rain as soon as the ground is sufficiently dry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span>
During dry, hot weather loss of moisture from the soil will be diminished
by frequent shallow cultivations.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="HARVESTING" id="HARVESTING">HARVESTING.</a></h2>


<p>Drug roots are usually harvested in the fall or at the end of the
growing season of the plant, but they may also be harvested early in
the spring while still dormant. Roots collected during the growing
season often shrink excessively in drying and so do not form the
most desirable product. On small areas either a spade or a potato
fork is a suitable tool for digging most roots; but if the area is large,
labor will be saved by using a plow to turn out the roots, especially
with such crops as belladonna or burdock. Most roots require thorough
washing, and when the quantity is large this may be easily
done if the roots are placed on a frame covered with wire mesh and
water is applied by means of a garden hose.</p>

<p>All roots must be thoroughly dried. Large or fleshy roots are
usually split or sliced, spread in thin layers on clean floors, and
stirred or turned frequently. Good ventilation is essential, as several
weeks usually elapse before the roots are dry enough to be stored
with safety. The proper point of dryness is indicated when the
roots break readily on being bent. The time of drying may be reduced
to a few days by the use of artificial heat. For this purpose
the walls of a well-inclosed room are fitted with racks or shelves to
receive the roots, or large trays with bottoms made of slats or wire
screen are suspended one above the other from the ceiling. The room
is heated by a stove, and the temperature maintained between 125
and 150 F. Ventilators must be provided at the top of the room
to carry away the moisture which is driven off from the roots. Ordinary
fruit driers have been used successfully in drying roots on, a
small scale, but special drying houses or kilns will be necessary for
successfully handling crops grown on an acreage basis.</p>

<p>Leaves and herbs are usually harvested when the plants are in
flower. Picking the leaves by hand in the field is a slow process, and
time may be saved by cutting the entire plant and stripping the
leaves after the plants have been brought in from the field. If the
entire herb is wanted, it is preferable to top the plants, for if they are
cut too close to the ground the herb will have to be picked over by
hand and all the coarse stems removed. As a rule, leaves and herbs
may be dried in the same manner as roots, but almost without exception
they are dried without exposure to the sun, in order that the
green color may be retained so far as possible.</p>

<p>Some flowers are gathered while scarcely open and others as soon
after opening as possible, and in general they should be carefully
dried in the shade to prevent discoloration. Hand picking is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span>
laborious, and mechanical devices similar to a cranberry scoop (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>)
or seed stripper (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) may often be used to good advantage. A
homemade picker may
be constructed as follows:
From a stout
wooden box, about 10
inches wide, 14 inches
long, and 6 inches deep,
remove one end and
connect the opposite remaining
sides at the top
with a stout strip, which
will serve as a handle. Drive long, slender wire nails through an
inch strip of wood at quarter-inch intervals, thus forming a "comb"
the teeth of which should be about 2 inches long. This comb is
fastened to the bottom of the box in such a manner that the teeth will
project outward through the opening left by the removed end. On
swinging this device, teeth forward, through the flowers, the heads
will be snapped off by the comb and will fall into the box, from
which they may be emptied into suitable containers.</p>

<p>Seeds are harvested as soon as most of them have ripened and before
the pods or seed capsules have opened. Seedlike fruits, such as
anise, coriander, fennel, and wormseed r are harvested a little before
they are fully ripe, in order that they may retain a bright, fresh
appearance, which adds to their
market value. The machinery used
for thrashing and cleaning ordinary
seed crops will frequently
serve a similar purpose for seeds
of medicinal plants, provided the
proper adjustments have been
made. Most seeds must be spread
out to dry and turned at intervals
until thoroughly dried before they
can be stored in quantity.</p>

<h2><a name="DISTILLATION" id="DISTILLATION">DISTILLATION.</a></h2>


<p>The volatile oil obtained from
many aromatic plants by steam distillation
is often their most valuable
product. The equipment necessary
for distilling volatile oils consists essentially of a steam boiler,
a retort, and a condenser. A constant supply of cold water must also
be available. A common type of retort consists of a circular wooden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span>
vat, about 6 feet in diameter and 8 to 10 feet deep (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>), fitted with
a removable cover, which can be made steam tight. Metal retorts
made of boiler iron three-sixteenths of an inch thick and jacketed
with wood to prevent the radiation of heat are also used. A pipe
leads from the steam boiler to the bottom of the retort and another
from the top of the retort to the condenser, one form of which consists
of a coil of tin-lined or galvanized-iron pipe inclosed in a jacket
through which cold water is kept flowing when the still is in operation.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;A still used in the production of wormwood oil.</div>
</div>

<p>When the retort is filled with aromatic plants and steam is admitted
through the pipe from the boiler, the volatile oil is extracted in
the form of a vapor, which is carried over with the steam to the condenser,
where both are condensed to liquid form. The oil and water
together flow from the condenser into the receiver, one type of which
is constructed like an ordinary milk can and is fitted with a siphon
leading from the bottom, through which the water is drawn off to
prevent the receiver from overflowing.</p>

<p>Many volatile oils will float on the water and may be drawn off
from the top of the receiver at will. Other oils, such as sassafras and
wintergreen, are heavier than water, and should be collected in a
receiver provided at the bottom with an outlet tap through which the
oil may be drawn off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span></p>

<p>The cost of setting up a still will depend upon what facilities are
already at hand and upon the size and efficiency of the apparatus
installed. It may easily range from a small sum to several thousand
dollars.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="YIELD" id="YIELD">YIELD.</a></h2>


<p>The yield that can be obtained from drug plants in different localities
will naturally vary according to the suitability of the situation
for the plants selected for cultivation. Even in the same locality
wide variations in yield will result from differences in the lay of the
land and in soil, drainage, and seasonal conditions. The skill of the
grower and the degree of care and attention which he bestows upon
his crop are also factors affecting yield.</p>

<p>Many of the drug plants mentioned in this bulletin have not been
grown on a scale large enough to give a very satisfactory basis for
calculating yields. Acreage yields calculated from the product of
small garden plats are generally untrustworthy, since in such plats
the plants are usually more favorably situated with respect to soil
and are given better culture than when under field conditions. Moreover,
as the area increases, it becomes more difficult to maintain an
approximately perfect stand and to protect the crop from the ravages
of insects or other destructive agencies. The returns from small experimental
areas can at most be regarded as only an indication of the
yield that may be expected under favorable conditions, and the
prospective grower will do well to proceed cautiously until he has
determined for himself the possibilities of yield in his particular
location.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="MARKETING" id="MARKETING">MARKETING.</a></h2>


<p>The commercial grower of drug plants can not give too much
attention to the problem of securing a satisfactory market for his
product. Growers who live near the cities in which dealers in crude
drugs are located or in sections where wild medicinal plants are collected
may be able to find a local market, but in many situations the
local marketing of crude drugs in quantity will not be possible. In
such cases the grower should send samples of his product to dealers
in crude drugs or to manufacturers of pharmaceutical preparations
and request them to name a price at which they would purchase his
crop. The material for the samples should not be specially selected
or so prepared as to represent a quality higher than that of the whole
lot, since this would give the purchaser just cause for making a
reduction in price on delivery or for rejecting the whole shipment.
It is well to send samples to a number of dealers, since their prices
will be found to vary with the stock on hand and trade prospects.
Before selling, the state of the wholesale drug market should be
learned. The prices to producers are, of course, always lower than
the wholesale price; nevertheless, the grower who is informed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span>
respect to the wholesale market will be in a position to judge of the
fairness of the prices offered for his crop by dealers.</p>

<p>Under special conditions some crude drugs can be sold at a material
advance over the prevailing market price. By always supplying
a well-prepared, carefully selected drug of high quality some
growers have built up a trade in their particular product for which
they secure extra good prices. Dealers and manufacturers also sometimes
make contracts with reliable growers to take the entire crop
of a particular drug, thus insuring to the grower a definite market
and good prices for the product.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="COMMERCIAL_PROSPECTS" id="COMMERCIAL_PROSPECTS">COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS.</a></h2>


<p>At the close of the year 1919 there existed a general and widespread
shortage in botanical crude drugs, and prices in consequence had
reached unusually high levels. The demand in other lines for unskilled
labor at high wages has attracted elsewhere many persons
who were formerly engaged in the collection or production of botanic
drugs in this country. It is therefore probable that prices for most
crude drugs will remain at a high level until the prices of other commodities
undergo a general reduction and the present supply of labor
greatly increases.</p>

<p>Although the average value of crude drugs, expressed in terms of
money, has more than doubled since 1913, it does not follow that their
production offers a corresponding increase in profit to the producer.
The prices of food and clothing, labor, and supplies of all kinds have
for the most part more than doubled in the same time and the prospective
producer of crude drugs will do well to consider carefully the
comparative prices of the necessities of life which he must purchase
before he engages in this enterprise. The unusually high prices now
offered for many crude drugs are due to the underproduction, which
has resulted largely from labor conditions and do not necessarily indicate
any large increase in the demand for consumption. In view of
the present disturbed economic conditions and the uncertainty as to
the future course of prices, the general stimulation of drug growing
in this country does not appear to be the best policy at this time.</p>

<p>However desirable it may be to increase the available supply of
crude drugs or to diminish the amount of money now sent to foreign
countries for these products, the most important consideration for
the American farmer who would grow drug plants is the probable
profit to be derived from such an enterprise. Many statements to
the contrary notwithstanding, the commercial production of crude
drugs does not normally present unusual opportunities for quick returns
and large profits. Knowledge respecting the cultivation and
handling of medicinal-plant crops is far less widespread than in the
case of such generally distributed crops as fruits, vegetables, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span>
cereals, and certain individuals have taken advantage of this lack of
information to lead the public to believe that extraordinary profits
may be realized from growing medicinal plants, even in a situation
no more promising than the average city back yard. Such persons
are interested usually only in the sale of the plants and seeds for
propagation or the questionable directions for their cultivation, and
the extravagant claims often set forth in their alluring advertisements
are not only misleading, but frequently have little basis in fact.</p>

<p>The market demand for any given crude drug is naturally a large
factor in determining the prospects for its commercial production
under cultivation. The demand for a number of drugs is quite
variable or exceedingly limited, and hence insufficient to make it advisable
to raise them on a large scale. In the case of other drugs,
although the demand is fairly constant and steady, it could probably
be fully satisfied by the product of a very few acres of good land. It
is evident that the cultivation of any considerable acreage might
easily result in overproduction, with a consequent decline in market
price to a point where production would not be profitable.</p>

<p>The cultivation of drug plants, to be successful in this country,
will probably require the introduction of improved methods and the
extensive use of machinery to replace hand labor so far as possible.
Growers of mints and numerous other plants yielding essential oils
will find it desirable to equip themselves with a suitable distilling
plant, although the latter can not be operated most economically
when only a small quantity of material is available for distillation.
The natural tendency will be to increase the acreage in the interest
of more efficient operation, but here again there is danger of overproduction,
and prospective growers should thoroughly acquaint themselves
with market conditions before bringing very large areas under
cultivation.</p>

<p>Very few, if any, drug plants are used in quantities sufficient to
make them a promising crop for general cultivation. Many of the
common ones, which can be grown and prepared for market with
little difficulty, bring but a few cents a pound, and their cultivation
offers little prospect of profit. A number of the high-priced drug
plants must be given care for two or more years before a crop can be
harvested, and, since expensive equipment is usually required for
their successful culture, the production of such crops offers little encouragement
to inexperienced growers who are looking for quick returns
and large profits from a small investment. The production of
drugs of high quality requires skilled management, experience in
special methods of plant culture, acquaintance with trade requirements,
and a knowledge of the influence of time of collection and
manner of preparation on the constituents of the drug which determine
its value. Small quantities of drugs produced without regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span>
to these conditions are apt to be poor in quality and so unattractive
to dealers and manufacturers that the product will not be
salable at a price sufficient to make their production profitable. In
general, the conditions in this country seem far more favorable to the
growing of drug plants as a special industry for well-equipped cultivators
than as a side crop for general farmers or those whose chief
interest lies in the production of other crops.</p>

<p>Although a number of plants which yield products used as crude
drugs are common farm weeds, they usually occur in scattered situations
and in such small quantities that their collection would
scarcely prove profitable for the farmer. Even when relatively
abundant it is a matter for careful consideration whether the time
and labor necessary for their collection might not be otherwise
employed to better advantage. Moreover, it is not always easy to
distinguish medicinal plants from others of similar appearance, and
collectors not infrequently find that they have spent their time in
gathering plants practically worthless as crude drugs. In proportion
to the labor required in their collection, relatively low prices
are paid for most crude drugs obtained from wild plants, and the
farmer who turns to drug collecting as a source of additional revenue
will probably meet with disappointment.</p>

<p>The following cultural directions and suggestions regarding the
handling of a number of drug plants have been compiled in part
from the records of the Office of Drug, Poisonous, and Oil Plant Investigations
and include data secured by various members of the
staff of that office connected with testing gardens in several widely
separated localities. The probable yields per acre are in many cases
estimates calculated from smaller areas, and considerable variation
from the figures given must be expected in actual practice. The
prices mentioned are given merely to indicate the comparative value
of the products concerned and not to fix the actual price which the
grower of drug plants may expect to receive. This will depend very
largely upon the state of the market at the time the crop is offered
for sale.</p>

<p>The plants mentioned in the following pages were selected for
discussion because information regarding their cultivation is in constant
demand. The purpose of this bulletin is not to recommend
these plants for cultivation, but to give information concerning their
culture which may be helpful to persons who are considering the

<h2><a name="ALETRIS" id="ALETRIS">ALETRIS.</a></h2>


<p>Aletris, star-grass, or true unicorn root (<i>Aletris farinosa</i>, <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>) is a native
perennial herb of the lily family, found occasionally on sandy soil throughout
the eastern half of the United States; also frequently occurring in the pine
and oak barrens of Alabama and Tennessee and elsewhere in the South. The
root is used medicinally.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 221px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;Aletris (<i>Aletris farinosa</i>).</div>
</div>

<p>Aletris is a slow-growing plant which seems to thrive best on a moist and
sandy soil. It may be propagated either by division of the root stocks or
from seeds. The seeds mature late in the summer, and should be sown soon
after ripening, in a well-prepared and protected seed bed. In the following
spring the seedlings may be transplanted to their permanent situation and set
about a foot apart in rows 20 inches or more apart. The soil about the plants
should be stirred frequently and kept
free from weeds.</p>

<p>The root, consisting of a short horizontal
rootstock bearing numerous small
rootlets, may be harvested in the fall of
the second or third year. In preparing
the root for market the stem and leaves
are broken off and the dirt is removed
by shaking (or washing, if necessary),
after which it is well dried. There are
no available data on the probable yield.
The prewar prices paid to collectors
for aletris usually ranged from 12 to 25
cents a pound. The prices in June,
1920, were about 70 cents a pound.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="ACONITE" id="ACONITE">ACONITE.</a></h2>


<p>Aconite (<i>Aconitum napellus</i>) is a
hardy perennial, introduced from Europe
and sparingly grown in this country as
an ornamental garden plant. Both leaves
and roots are very poisonous, the latter forming the official drug. Other
varieties than <i>Aconitum napellus</i> are also grown in flower gardens, and several
species occur wild in the United States. Since the official species readily
hybridizes with related varieties, often to the detriment of its medicinal properties,
it is frequently difficult to secure seed which will come true to name.</p>

<p>Aconite seems to thrive best in a rather cool climate and will grow in any
rich garden soil, but a well-drained gravelly loam in an elevated situation appears
most suited for the cultivation of this plant. It may be grown from seed
sown in the open late in the fall or early in the spring, or plants may be
started in a seed bed and the seedlings later transplanted and set about a foot
apart in rows 2 feet apart. The preferable method of propagation is by division
of the roots after the stems have died down in the fall, since thereby
hybridization may be avoided.</p>

<p>The plants usually flower in the second year from seed, when the roots may
be harvested. It is preferable, however, to defer harvesting until the stems
have died down in the fall, when all the roots should be dug, the smaller reserved
for planting and the larger ones washed, sliced lengthwise, and dried.
The leaves are also harvested, but are not in much demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span></p>

<p>Reliable data on yield are not available, although some estimates place the
yield at about 450 pounds of dry root per acre. The American market is supplied
with imported aconite root, for which the prewar price ranged from
about 9 to 15 cents a pound. The price in June, 1920, ranged from 60 to
62 cents a pound. The quantity imported in 1919 was about 35,000 pounds.
The demand for this drug is limited, and this fact, together with the probable
low yield, makes its profitable cultivation in this country very doubtful.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="ALTHAEA" id="ALTHAEA">ALTHAEA.</a></h2>


<p>Althaea, or marshmallow (<i>Althaea officinalis</i>), is a perennial herb introduced
from Europe which now grows wild in marshy places near the sea in Massachusetts
and along tidal rivers in New York and Pennsylvania. The root forms
the official drug, but the leaves and flowers also are sometimes used medicinally.</p>

<p>Althaea will grow well in almost any loose garden soil of moderate fertility,
but tends to winterkill in situations where the ground freezes to a considerable
depth. The plants may be propagated from seeds or from divisions of the old
roots made early in the spring. The seed may be sown in the open in shallow
drills at least 3 feet apart, and the seedlings should be thinned to stand 16
inches apart in the row. Under good conditions the plants attain a height of 3
or 4 feet; therefore, close planting does not give sufficient room for full development.</p>

<p>In the second year of growth the roots are harvested, washed, peeled, cut into
short lengths, and thoroughly dried. Yields at the rate of 800 to 1,000 pounds
of dry root per acre have been obtained. The prewar wholesale price usually
ranged from 12 to 20 cents a pound. The price in June, 1920, was 25 to 27
cents a pound. The annual importation of this root averages about 30,000
pounds. In view of the amount of hand labor required in preparing the root,
the relatively low price, and the rather limited demand, the cultivation of this
plant for profit is not very attractive.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="ANGELICA" id="ANGELICA">ANGELICA.</a></h2>


<p>Angelica (<i>Angelica officinalis</i>) is a European biennial plant of the parsley
family, sometimes grown in this country as a culinary herb and known commonly
as garden angelica. The fresh stems and leafstalks are used as a garnish
and for making a candied confection. The seeds and the oil distilled from them
are employed in flavoring, and the aromatic roots are sometimes used in
medicine.</p>

<p>Angelica thrives best in a moderately cool climate and may be grown in any
good soil, although a deep, fairly rich loam which is moist but well drained
will give the best results. The soil should be deeply plowed and well prepared
before planting. The plant is most readily propagated from divisions of old
roots, which may be set either in the fall or spring about 18 inches apart in
rows. The seeds germinate very poorly if more than one year old, and it is
best to sow them as soon as they are ripe in a seed bed, which should be kept
moist by frequent watering if necessary. Early in the following spring the
seedlings are transplanted and set about 2 feet apart each way in their permanent
location. Plants may also be obtained from seeds sown in March in
a spent hotbed or in a cold frame. In order to increase the root development,
the plants are often transplanted a second time, at the end of the first year's
growth, and set 3 or 4 feet apart. For the same reason the tops are often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"> 17 </a></span>
cut back to prevent the formation of seed. During the growing seasons the
soil should be kept mellow and free from weeds by frequent cultivation.</p>

<p>The roots are usually harvested in the fall of the second year, but sometimes
those of the first-year plants are marketed. After being dug, the roots are
washed and dried in the open air. In order to keep out insects and to preserve
the aroma it is best to store the dried root in tin containers which can be tightly
closed. The root of the European or garden angelica found in our drug markets
is imported largely from Germany. During the past few years the wholesale
price has averaged about 20 cents a pound.</p>

<p>The root of a native species of angelica (<i>Angelica atropurpurea</i>), commonly
called American angelica, also occurs in the drug markets of this country. It
is collected from wild plants, and the price to collectors in former years usually
ranged from 6 to 10 cents a pound. The prices in June, 1920, were for the seed
20 cents and for the root 14 cents a pound.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="ANISE" id="ANISE">ANISE.</a></h2>


<p>Anise (<i>Pimpinella anisum</i>) is an annual herb of the parsley family, widely
cultivated in Europe and to a limited extent in this country, chiefly in Rhode
Island. Although this plant may be grown quite generally throughout the
United States, it has been found difficult to bring the crop to maturity in
northerly situations where the growing season is short or in the South where
the climate is hot and dry. It is grown chiefly for its aromatic seeds (fruits),
which are used medicinally, and also in baking and for flavoring confectionery.
The oil distilled from the seeds is used medicinally in cordials, and
also for flavoring various beverages.</p>

<p>Anise thrives best in a light, moderately rich, and well-drained loam which
has been carefully prepared before planting. It is grown from seeds, which
are usually sown early in the spring directly in the field, since the seedlings
are unfavorably affected by transplanting. The seeds, which should not be
more than 2 years old, are sown thickly, about two to the inch, and covered
one-half inch deep. Since the plants develop very slowly, seed should not be
sown in weedy soil. When the seedlings are 2 to 3 inches high they are thinned
to stand 6 inches apart in the row. The rows may be 18 inches or 3 feet
apart, depending on the cultivation intended. An ounce of seed should sow
a row 150 feet long, and about 5 pounds will plant an acre when the rows are
3 feet apart. The plants should receive frequent and thorough cultivation
throughout the growing season.</p>

<p>About three months from the time of planting the plants will blossom, and
a month later the seed should be matured sufficiently for harvesting. As soon
as the tips of the seeds turn a grayish green color they should be harvested,
for if allowed to remain exposed to the weather they quickly turn brown or
blacken. The plants may be pulled by hand and stacked, tops inward, in heaps
about 6 feet high, or they may be mowed and at once built up into cocks of
the same height. In about four or five days the seed will have ripened, after
which it should be thrashed out and thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<p>Yields of anise seed are quite variable, since the plant is very sensitive to
unfavorable weather conditions. In a good season from 400 to 600 pounds per
acre may be reasonably expected. The prewar wholesale price usually ranged
from 6 to 8 cents a pound. The prices in June, 1920, ranged from 19 to
30 cents a pound. During the war the average annual importation of 500
tons was reduced to about 180 tons.</p>

<h2><a name="ARNICA" id="ARNICA">ARNICA.</a></h2>


<p>Arnica (<i>Arnica montana</i>) is a herbaceous perennial plant of the aster family,
native in northern and central Europe, where it thrives in the cool climate of
the mountain meadows and upland moors. The flowers, leaves, and roots are
employed in medicine.</p>

<p>Arnica requires a marshy soil, abundant rainfall, and a cool climate for its
best development. It is propagated by divisions of the roots or from seeds
sown either in the fall or the spring. Seed may also be sown in August in a
seed bed and the plants transplanted the following spring to stand about 18
inches apart in the row. The flowers may be harvested the second year and
the roots after three or four years.</p>

<p>Arnica is not produced commercially in the United States, and the small
quantity imported annually is apparently sufficient to meet the market demands.
Its cultivation presents many difficulties, and efforts to grow it in
the milder portions of this country have generally proved unsuccessful.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="BELLADONNA" id="BELLADONNA">BELLADONNA.</a></h2>


<p>Belladonna, or deadly nightshade (<i>Atropa belladonna</i>), is a large, poisonous
perennial which occurs wild in Europe, where it is also cultivated. Both the
leaves and the roots are important crude drugs. In recent years it has been
cultivated to some extent in this country, but is likely to winterkill in the
colder sections.</p>

<p>Belladonna may be propagated in a small way from cuttings of the young
shoots rooted in moist sand in the usual manner or from divisions of the fleshy
rootstocks made early in the spring, but it is most readily grown from seeds
which may be thinly sown in pots or well-drained boxes in a cool greenhouse
in midwinter or in a sheltered place in a garden early in the spring. When
the seedlings are large enough to handle they should be transplanted singly to
small pots or pricked out in flats or shallow boxes of light, rich soil, placing
them about 2 inches apart each way, as with tomato or other vegetable plants
intended for field planting. In the spring, as soon as danger from frost is over,
they should be transplanted to the field and set about 20 inches apart in rows
30 or more inches apart Sowing seeds in the field or transplanting directly
from the seed bed to the field has rarely given good results in this country.
Belladonna seeds are small, and if well handled under glass or in protected
seed beds 1 ounce should produce 10,000 or more plants, sufficient to set an acre.</p>

<p>Belladonna thrives best in deep, moist, well-drained loam containing lime,
such as will under proper fertilization produce good garden vegetables. The
preparation of the soil should be very thorough and consists of deep plowing,
either in the fall or early spring, and repeated working with the disk or spring-tooth
and smoothing harrows. Weeds should be kept under control at all times
and the soil stirred with a hoe or cultivator at intervals of about 10 days, particularly
after each hard rain, and shallow cultivation given in hot, dry weather
to conserve the natural moisture of the soil. Good commercial fertilizers, such
as are commonly used in truck gardens, are beneficial. Those containing 8 per
cent of phosphoric acid, 4 per cent of nitrogen, and 4 per cent of potash are the
most desirable and should be applied at the rate of about 600 pounds per acre.
Stable manure at the rate of 12 to 20 tons to the acre may be used if plowed
under when the ground is prepared.</p>

<p>Belladonna is sometimes affected by a wilt disease, which is aggravated by
wet soils and fresh animal manures, and the foliage is greedily attacked by the
potato beetle. Dusting with lime, spot, or road dust in the morning when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19 </a></span>
leaves are wet with dew is occasionally effective. The destructive attacks of
these pests are usually confined to the seed bed or to first-year plantings, but
the insects may be controlled by the careful use of insecticides.</p>

<p>The leaves are picked when the plants are in full bloom. They should be
carefully handled, to avoid bruising, and dried in the shade in order to retain
their green color. A hundred pounds of fresh leaves yield about 18 pounds
when well dried. One crop only can be collected the year of planting, but two
crops are gathered in each of the next two or three years, after which it
appears better to market the roots and make new plantings. While only the
leaves should be collected for the best pharmaceutical trade, the young growth,
including the smaller sappy twigs, has medicinal value and may be sheared
from the plants and dried in the same manner as the leaves. The ease of collection
and increased weight of material may render the latter method more
profitable.</p>

<p>The roots alone are not as profitable as the leaves. The best roots are
those of the second and third year's growth. They are harvested in the fall
after frost, the tops being mowed and raked off and the roots turned out with
a deep-running plow, or with a potato fork if the area be small. They are
carefully washed and cut into about 4-inch lengths, the larger pieces being
split lengthwise to aid in drying. Thorough drying either in the sun or with
mild artificial heat is essential; otherwise, the roots will mold when stored.</p>

<p>The high prices paid for belladonna during the war greatly stimulated the
cultivation of this crop, which had previously been grown with some success
in California, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and some other
States. In 1918, 273 acres of belladonna were harvested, the total production
being about 83 tons of herb (including leaves and stems), an average of 600
pounds per acre. From 136 acres 11 tons of root were harvested, an average
of 164 pounds per acre. The marketing of this crop was followed by a decline
in prices, the quotations in June, 1920, being 30 to 35 cents a pound for the herb
and 55 cents a pound for the root.</p>

<h2><a name="BLUE_FLAG" id="BLUE_FLAG">BLUE FLAG.</a></h2>


<p>Blue flag (<i>Iris versicolor</i>) is a native perennial plant of common occurrence
in swamps and marshy situations throughout the eastern half of the United
States. The underground stem (rhizome) and roots are the parts of the plant
used medicinally.</p>

<p>Blue flag responds readily to cultivation when placed in a rich, moist, and
rather heavy soil. It is readily propagated from divisions of old plants, which
may be set 1 foot apart in rows spaced conveniently for cultivation. If the
plants are set in August or September, the crop may be harvested about, the
last of October in the following year. The roots may be turned out with a
deep-running plow, and after being thoroughly washed and the larger clusters
broken up they should be thoroughly dried. Artificial drying at low heat is
usually desirable.</p>

<p>Yields at the rate of 3 or 4 tons of dried root per acre have been obtained
from small plats. The prewar price paid to collectors varied from year to
year and usually ranged from 5 to 10 cents a pound. The price in June,
1920, was 35 cents a pound. This crop does not appear to be very promising,
owing to the relatively small demand for the root</p>

<h2><a name="BONESET" id="BONESET">BONESET.</a></h2>


<p>Boneset (<i>Eupatorium perfoliatum</i>) is a hardy, rather long-lived perennial
plant commonly found growing in low grounds throughout the eastern half of
the United States. The dried leaves and flowering tops form the official drug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span></p>

<p>Divisions of clumps of wild plants collected early in the fall will serve for
propagation. These may be set about a foot apart in rows in well-prepared
soil. During the first winter the newly set divisions should be protected with
a light mulch of straw or manure. Plants may also be grown from seeds, which
should be collected as soon as ripe and sown in shallow drills about 8 inches
apart in a rich, moist seed bed, preferably in partial shade. When of sufficient
size they may be set in the field at about the same distance as the divided
clumps.</p>

<p>The plants are cut late in the summer when in full bloom and the leaves and
flowering tops stripped from the stem by hand and carefully dried without exposure
to the sun. Yields of well-cultivated boneset are quite large and 2,000
pounds or more per acre of dry herb may be obtained under favorable conditions.
The prewar price for boneset rarely exceeded 2 to 3 cents a pound.
The price in June, 1920, was 12 to 13 cents a pound. Since the demand is
limited and the wild supply fairly available, the cultivation of boneset does not
offer much prospect of profit.</p>

<h2><a name="BURDOCK" id="BURDOCK">BURDOCK.</a></h2>


<p>Burdock (<i>Arctium lappa</i>) is a large biennial plant well known as a common
and troublesome weed in the Eastern and Central States and in some western
localities. The dried root from plants of the first year's growth forms the
official drug, but the seeds and leaves are also used medicinally.</p>

<p>Burdock will grow in almost any soil, but the best root development is favored
by a light well-drained soil rich in humus. The seeds germinate readily and
may be sown directly in the field, either late in the fall or early in the spring.
The seed may be sown in drills 18 inches or 3 feet apart, as desired, and should
be sown 1 inch deep if in the fall, but less deeply if sown in the spring. When
the seedlings are well up they should be thinned to stand about 6 inches apart
in the row. Cultivation should continue as long as the size of the plants will
permit.</p>

<p>The roots are harvested at the end of the first year's growth in order to
secure the most acceptable drug and also to prevent the plants from bearing
seed and spreading as a weed. The tops of the plants may be cut with a mower
and raked off, after which the roots can usually be turned out with a deep-running
plow or with a beet lifter. In a dry and very sandy soil the roots frequently
extend to a depth of 2 or 3 feet, making it necessary to dig them by
hand. After digging, any remaining tops are removed and the roots are washed
and dried, the drying being preferably by the use of low artificial heat. The
roots are usually split lengthwise into two or more pieces in order to facilitate
drying, although whole roots are marketable.</p>

<p>Yields at the rate of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds of dry roots per acre have been
obtained. The prewar prices offered by dealers ranged from 4 to 6 cents a
pound. The prices for the root and seed in June, 1920, were 12 cents a
pound each.</p>

<h2><a name="CALAMUS" id="CALAMUS">CALAMUS.</a></h2>


<p>Calamus, or sweet flag (<i>Acorus calamus</i>), is a native perennial plant, occurring
frequently along streams and in the edges of swamps throughout the
eastern half of the United States. The dried root (rhizome or rootstock) is the
part used as a drug.</p>

<p>Although calamus in a wild state is usually found growing in water, it may
be cultivated in almost any good soil which is fairly moist. It usually does well
on moderately dry upland soils which will produce fair crops of corn or potatoes.
The plants are readily propagated from divisions of old roots, which
should be set early in the fall 1 foot apart in rows and well covered. During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"> 21 </a></span>
the following growing season the plants should receive frequent and thorough
cultivation.</p>

<p>The roots are harvested in the fall and may be readily dug with a spade or
turned out with a plow. The tops, together with about an inch of the rootstock,
are next cut off and used to make new plantings. The roots are washed
and dried artificially at a moderately low degree of heat. The marketable
product consists of the thick rootstocks deprived of their small rootlets often
called "fibers." These may be removed before drying, but more easily afterwards,
since when dry and brittle they break off readily with a little handling.
Roots thus treated are often called "stripped" and are more aromatic than
those which have been peeled.</p>

<p>Yields at the rate of 2,000 pounds of dry roots per acre have been obtained.
The prewar price for the unpeeled root usually ranged from 3 to 5 cents a
pound. The prices in June, 1920, were 10 to 12 cents a pound. The annual
importation of calamus root ranges from 5 to 10 tons.</p>

<h2><a name="CALENDULA" id="CALENDULA">CALENDULA.</a></h2>


<p>Calendula, or pot marigold (<i>Calendula officinalis</i>), is a hardy annual plant
native to southern Europe, but frequently grown in flower gardens in this
country. The dried flower heads are sometimes used in soups and stews, and the
so-called petals (ligulate florets) are employed in medicine.</p>

<p>Calendula grows well on a variety of soils, but a moderately rich garden loam
will give the best results. The seed may be sown in open ground early in the
spring in drills 18 inches apart. As soon as the seedlings are well established
they should be thinned to stand about a foot apart in the row. In the North it
is desirable to sow the seed about the first of April in coldframes or spent hotbeds
and transplant the young seedlings as soon as the danger of frost is past.</p>

<p>The plants blossom early and continue to bloom throughout the summer. The
flowers are gathered at intervals of a few days and carefully dried. The petals
(florets) which form the drug may be removed either before or after the flower
heads are dried. The petals are removed by hand, but this process requires so
much time that when the cost of the necessary labor is taken into account it is
doubtful whether the price received for the drug would cover the cost of production.</p>

<p>The dried whole flowers produced in this country were quoted in the wholesale
markets in June, 1920, at 25 cents to $1 a pound, according to quality;
the petals, at $1.95 to $2.10 a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="CAMOMILE_GERMAN" id="CAMOMILE_GERMAN">CAMOMILE, GERMAN.</a></h2>


<p>German camomile (<i>Matricaria chamomilla</i>) is a European annual herb of the
aster family, cultivated in this country in gardens, from which it has escaped
in some localities. The dried flower heads are used in medicine.</p>

<p>This species of camomile does well on moderately heavy soil which is rich in
humus and rather moist. Since the plants bloom about eight weeks after sowing
the seed, a crop of camomile may be grown from seed sown either early in
the spring or late in the summer, following early vegetable crops. The seed
may be sown in drills and barely covered or may be broadcast, since the plants
will soon occupy the ground and exclude the weeds. When the plants are
In full bloom the flower heads are gathered and may be spread thinly on canvas
sheets and dried in the sun. All leaves and stems should be removed, and
when the flowers are thoroughly dry they should be packed for market in boxes
or bales rather than in bags, since in the latter the flowers are likely to be
badly broken in handling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22 </a></span></p>

<p>Returns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about 400 pounds
of dry flowers per acre may be expected under favorable conditions. Prewar
wholesale prices usually ranged from about 15 to 40 cents a pound. The prices
in June, 1920, were 41 to 43 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="CAMOMILE_ROMAN" id="CAMOMILE_ROMAN">CAMOMILE, ROMAN.</a></h2>


<p>Roman camomile (also called English camomile, <i>Anthemis nobilis</i>) is a
European perennial herb of the aster family, frequently cultivated in gardens
in this country and sometimes found growing wild. In America, camomile is
grown chiefly as an ornamental plant, especially for use in borders, since the
plants blossom from midsummer until killed by frost. The dried flower heads
from cultivated plants are used in medicine.</p>

<p>Camomile grows well in almost any good, rather dry soil which has full exposure
to the sun. The plants may be grown from seeds or propagated by
dividing the roots early in the spring. The divisions of the root may be planted
9 inches apart in rows spaced according to the method of cultivation to be
used. When planted on a small scale the divisions, or offsets, may be set 9
inches apart each way in carefully prepared soil. Hand weeding is necessary,
but since the plants soon spread and fully shade the ground, weeds usually
have small chance of becoming troublesome.</p>

<p>The flower heads are gathered just as they open, either by hand or by means
of a flower picker, and are dried in the open in bright weather or, when necessary,
on canvas trays in a heated room. Rapid drying is essential, as it is
desirable to retain the white color as far as possible.</p>

<p>The yield is variable, but from 400 to 600 pounds of dried flowers per acre
may be expected. The prices for Roman camomile quoted in the wholesale
drug markets of this country prior to the war usually ranged from about 10
to 12 cents a pound. The prices in June, 1920, were 18 to 20 cents a pound.
Since this crop requires much hand labor, its cultivation in this country on a
commercial scale does not promise to be very profitable.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CAMPHOR" id="CAMPHOR">CAMPHOR.</a></h2>


<p>The camphor tree (<i>Camphora officinalis</i>) is a large evergreen, native to Asia.
It is hardy in situations where the winter temperature does not fall below
15 F., and for many years has been grown as an ornamental in the southern
and southwestern United States. Young trees suitable for planting as ornamentals
may usually be obtained from the nurseries in Florida and other
parts of the South, or they can be easily grown from fresh seed.</p>

<p>For culture on a commercial scale the climatic requirements of camphor
are practically the same as those of citrus fruits. The tree can be grown in
almost any soil, but the maximum growth is secured in soils which are rich
and well drained. When planted for commercial cultivation new land is
preferable. The following statements are based upon actual experiments and
observations on the growing and production of camphor under conditions
found in Florida.</p>

<p>Camphor seeds ripen about the middle of October and should be planted
while fresh, a better germination being obtained when the pulp is removed.
The seed bed should be selected with care and the precaution taken to have
one that will give sufficient moisture during the dry season and yet be well
drained. For small seed beds of 2 or 3 acres or less it may be practicable to
provide irrigation. Excellent stands of seedlings have been obtained on
slightly rolling land which originally was covered with "blackjack" oak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"> 23 </a></span></p>

<p>About the first of September, or somewhat earlier if conditions permit, the
land should be well plowed and thoroughly worked down with a disk harrow.
Just before the seeds are planted it should again be worked over and all roots
of Bermuda grass or other weeds removed, since rapidly growing grasses or
weeds will absorb so much moisture from the soil that the seeds can not
germinate.</p>

<p>The seeds begin to ripen during the first part of October and are usually
in a fairly well ripened stage by the last of that month. From this time
until the heavy frosts they can be gathered and planted with safety. Seeds
gathered after heavy frosts have been planted successfully, but it is not
advisable to take the risk of too hard a freeze. In determining the time to
gather seed a simple test is sufficient. Seeds that fall into the hand when the
cluster is slightly twisted are ripe enough to plant.</p>

<p>In planting, a cotton-dropping machine, modified somewhat to meet the
new requirements, may be used. The machine is set to plant the seeds 2 or 3
inches apart and cover them 1 inch deep in rows far enough apart to permit
horse cultivation. The plants begin to come up in about three months, but four
or five months are often required for a full stand. As soon as the plants can
be distinguished in the rows cultivation is begun, which at first is done by
hand with either a wheel or hand hoe. Later, as the plants attain size, a
horse cultivator can be used, but a certain amount of handwork is necessary
throughout the time the plants remain in the seed bed. When the plants are
well started they should receive a good application of sheep or goat manure
or of high-grade fertilizer.</p>

<p>The first season a growth of from 3 to 18 inches may be expected, the irregularity
of development depending on the vitality of the seed, variation in the
soil, and numerous other factors. The plants are allowed to grow in the seed
bed usually for a year and are then transplanted to the field. In transplanting
it is customary to separate the plants into two grades, "sturdy" and "weak,"
planting each grade in a field by itself. By doing this the replanting is simplified,
since the sturdy stock requires but few trees for replanting and the
weak stock, which will require considerable replanting, is all in one section.</p>

<p>Previous to transplanting, the land is well prepared by deep plowing and
thorough harrowing, and rows are laid off 15 feet apart. The young trees
are set in these rows 4 feet apart, either by hand or with a tree-setting
machine. This machine is simply a tobacco-setting machine fitted with a trench
opener set to open a furrow 8 inches deep, in which the trees are placed. The
trees used for transplanting are headed back to within 1 inch of the crown, and
the lower end of the taproot and all large laterals are removed. The taproot
of the tree as planted is thus reduced in length to 8 or 10 inches and varies in
diameter according to the vitality and previous growth of the seedling. Transplanting
should be done in the winter months, when the trees are dormant.</p>

<p>Cultivation is begun as soon as the trees put forth shoots in the spring and
continued until the rainy season of each year. After the rainy season the
plants are again cultivated and all grass and weeds removed. At times cultivation
is necessary during the rainy season in order to keep the trees from
becoming smothered and killed by the fast-growing weeds. One-horse cultivators
drawn by mules or a gang cultivator drawn by a light tractor may be used.</p>

<p>In three or four years, after transplanting, the trees should be from 7 to 8
feet high. They are then trimmed by means of a special machine<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to form an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> 24 </a></span>
<b>A</b>-shaped hedge and the trimmings distilled for the oil and camphor gum.
Trimming is carried on when the trees are in the dormant stage, which is twice
each year, usually November to January and May to June. The summer dormant
season is somewhat irregular and governed entirely by local conditions.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> A detailed description of this machine is given in U. S. Dept. of Agr. Cir. 78, entitled
"A Machine for Trimming Camphor Trees." 1920.</p></div>

<p>The cuttings are hauled from the field to the distilling plant, and if many
large branches are present they are run through a heavy ensilage cutter. For
distillation they are packed in large iron retorts, to which steam is admitted
at the bottom. The outlet pipe of the retort is connected with a specially constructed
condensing apparatus in which the oil and camphor carried over by
the steam are condensed and partly collected. Portions of oil and camphor
not collected in the condenser are caught in a tub fitted with an outlet siphon
which carries away the excess condensed steam but leaves the oil and camphor
behind.</p>

<p>When removed from the condenser the product is very crude, consisting of
a mixture of oil, water, and camphor. This mixture is either thrown into a
centrifuge and the oil and water removed or it is placed in large cylindrical
vats and the oil and water allowed to drain out. The oil is then separated
from the water by means of a siphon. The camphor and oil are marketed
separately.</p>

<p>The annual yield of cuttings has varied from 2 to 5 tons per acre, which
should give approximately 40 to 100 pounds of marketable camphor. At present
the planting of small areas does not seem advisable, in view of the heavy
outlay required for the machinery necessary to produce camphor gum at a
profit. An area of less than 500 acres would probably not warrant the installation
of the machinery necessary for the commercial production of camphor,
and 1,000 acres or more will doubtless give a greater net return per acre.
Although the crop is a low-priced one, under favorable conditions it is estimated
that a fair return per acre may be expected, but the data so far accumulated
are not sufficient to warrant specific statements concerning the profitableness
of the industry.</p>

<p>Camphor oil, or the oil from which camphor has been removed, is used in
Japan for illuminating purposes, and as a solvent for resins in the manufacture
of lacquer. It is used in Europe for its safrol content, and may probably be
utilized for the same purpose in this country. There exists already in the
American market a demand for the Japanese oil at prices ranging from 11 to
14 cents per pound.</p>

<p>Camphor imports into the United States usually exceed 3,000,000 pounds
annually; hence, it does not seem probable that there is any danger of overproduction
in the Southern States. However, it is possible that at times
camphor may be imported at a price so low as to render production in this
country financially unprofitable.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CANNABIS" id="CANNABIS">CANNABIS.</a></h2>


<p>The drug cannabis or Indian hemp (<i>Cannabis sativa</i>), consists of the dried
flowering tops of the female plants. It grows well over a considerable portion
of the United States, but the production of the active principle of this plant is
believed to be favored by a warm climate. For drug purposes, therefore, this
crop appears to be adapted to the Southern rather than to the Northern States.</p>

<p>Cannabis is propagated from seeds, which should be planted in the spring
as soon as conditions are suitable, in well-prepared sandy of clayey loam at a
depth of about an inch in rows 5 or 6 feet apart. The seeds may be dropped
every two or three inches in the row or planted in hills about a foot apart in the
row, 6 to 10 seeds being dropped into each hill. Two or three pounds of seed per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"> 25 </a></span>
acre should give a good stand. About half the seeds will produce male
plants, which must be removed before their flowers mature; otherwise, the
female plants will set seed, thereby diminishing their value as a drug. The
male plants can be recognized with certainty only by the presence of stamens in
their flowers.</p>

<p>Ordinary stable or barnyard manure plowed in deeply is better for use as a
fertilizer than commercial preparations and may be safely applied at the rate
of 20 tons per acre. However, good results may be obtained with commercial
fertilizers, such as are used for truck crops and potatoes, when cultivated in
between the rows at the rate of 500 or 600 pounds per acre.</p>

<p>When the female plants reach maturity, a sticky resin forms on the heavy,
compact flower clusters, and harvesting may then be begun. The tops of the
plants comprising the flower clusters are cut and carefully dried in the shade
to preserve the green color as far as possible. Drying can best be done, especially
in damp weather, by the use of artificial heat, not to exceed 140 F.</p>

<p>For several years cannabis of standard (U. S. P.) quality has been grown on
a commercial scale in this country, chiefly in South Carolina and Virginia. After
the flowering tops are harvested they are thoroughly dried under cover, then
worked over by hand, and all the stems and large foliage leaves removed. This
process gives a drug of high quality but greatly reduces the net or marketable
yield per acre, which usually ranges from 350 to 400 pounds. Some growers do
not remove the stems and leaves, thus increasing the acreage yield but reducing
the market value of their product. The quality of cannabis can be determined
only by special laboratory tests, which most dealers are not equipped to make;
consequently, they are usually unwilling to pay growers as high prices as they
would if the low-grade cannabis were kept off the market.</p>

<p>The market price in June, 1920, for tested (U. S. P.) domestic cannabis was
30 to 35 cents; for nontested, 20 to 25 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="CARAWAY" id="CARAWAY">CARAWAY.</a></h2>


<p>Caraway (<i>Carum carvi</i>) is a European biennial herb of the parsley family.
It grows and fruits well over a considerable portion of the United States,
especially in the North and Northwest, but its cultivation in this country seems
never to have assumed commercial proportions. The seeds are used medicinally,
but are mainly utilized for flavoring cakes, confectionery, and similar products.
On distillation with steam, the seeds yield an aromatic oil, which is more used
in medicine than the seed itself.</p>

<p>Soil of a somewhat clayey nature and containing a fair proportion of humus
and available plant food is particularly suited to caraway, but the plant
generally grows well in any good upland soil which will produce fair crops
of corn or potatoes. Seeds should be sown in early spring in drills about 16
inches apart, and from 6 to 8 pounds of seed are sown to the acre. Frequent
shallow cultivation throughout both growing seasons is desirable in order to
keep the soil mellow and free from weeds, as a weedy crop at harvest time
usually means a product inferior in quality.</p>

<p>As soon as the oldest seeds ripen, which is usually in June of the second
year, the crop should be harvested. The plants may be cut with a mower and
should be left in the swath until they have lost most of their moisture, when
they may be built up into small cocks, or they may be brought in from the
field and the curing finished in a barn loft. If on handling in the field the
seeds shatter extensively, the crop should be brought in in tight wagons.
When drying is finished the seeds are thrashed out, cleaned, and stored in bags
which contain about 100 pounds each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> 26 </a></span></p>

<p>Returns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about 1,000 pounds
of seed per acre may be expected. One hundred pounds of seed will usually
yield 4 to 6 pounds of oil. The average annual importation of caraway seed
for several years has been about 2,000,000 pounds, valued at about 9 cents a
pound. The war reduced the annual importations of oil of caraway from
30,000 to 9,000 pounds and increased the value from 80 cents to about $4.25
a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="CASCARA_SAGRADA" id="CASCARA_SAGRADA">CASCARA SAGRADA.</a></h2>


<p>Cascara, or cascara sagrada (<i>Rhamnus purshiana</i>), is a small tree 20 to 30
feet high, native to the Western part of the United States, and found most
abundantly in a narrow belt along the Pacific slope from northern California
to southern British Columbia. The bark from the trunk and branches is the
source of the drug, for which there is a constant and steady demand.</p>

<p>Plantings which have been made in the Eastern States indicate that this
tree may probably be grown along the Atlantic slope in the Piedmont or foothill
belt from Pennsylvania to Georgia. The trees have been found to grow better
in clay loam than in either sand or clay. Propagation from seed is easy, but
the seeds should be planted in the fall soon after they ripen or stratified in
sand until used, since germination is very poor if the seeds are allowed to
become dry. The seeds are sown in a seed bed under shade in drills 8 inches
apart and covered about 1 inch deep. The seedlings reach a height of 10 to 15
inches the first year, and in the following spring before the leaves appear they
are set in the field 6 feet apart each way. It is advisable to cultivate frequently,
in order to keep the weeds down and to maintain a shallow surface
mulch.</p>

<p>If the trees are pruned properly, a crop of bark may be harvested each year
without killing the whole tree, as is done in collecting the bark from wild trees.
At the time of transplanting, the trees are cut back to a straight stem about a
foot high, from which all except the four uppermost buds are removed. The
branches which afterwards develop from these buds are later deprived of their
lower side shoots, thus causing the tree to grow a head of four long, stout
branches instead of a single straight trunk. When the trees are large enough
to yield a crop of bark, the longest of the four branches is cut off early in the
spring flush with the trunk and a new branch is allowed to grow in its place.
This process may be repeated yearly, removing only the largest branches of
each tree in any one season.</p>

<p>The bark on the cut-off branches is divided with a sharp knife into lengthwise
strips of about an inch or two in width, which may be readily pulled off.
It is then dried carefully at a low temperature in the shade and broken into
small pieces to facilitate packing and handling.</p>

<p>The price paid to collectors for cascara bark, which before the war usually
varied from 1 to 4 cents a pound, in June, 1920, was about 10 cents a pound.
So long as a supply of the wild bark continues to be available it is doubtful
whether cascara can be cultivated at a profit.</p>

<p>The castor-oil plant or Palma Christi (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) is a robust perennial
in tropical countries which becomes an annual in regions subject to frost.
The seeds of this plant, called "castor beans" or "mole beans," yield the castor
oil of commerce. Between 1860 and 1900, the castor bean was an important
crop in certain sections of Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois, but
during recent years its culture has been practically abandoned in favor of
crops which are easier to handle and more profitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"> 27 </a></span></p>

<p>For the commercial production of castor beans a warm climate and long
growing season are necessary. If planted much farther north than St. Louis,
Mo., or Washington, D. C, the crop is very likely to be caught by frost. In
general, any fertile soil which produces good crops of cotton or corn is suitable
for castor beans, but a very fertile soil favors the growth of the plant at the expense
of seed production and early maturity. The land is prepared in much the
same manner as for cotton or corn; that is, plowed, disked, and harrowed level
before planting, which may be done by hand or with a corn planter with specially
prepared plates. The seed should be planted early in the spring, as soon
as the soil is warm but still moderately moist. The time of planting varies according
to locality, but in general corresponds to that of cotton.</p>

<p>The seed is planted in hills at a depth of 1 to 2 inches. Toward the north,
the rows are usually made 4 feet apart and the hills spaced 3 feet apart in the
row. Farther south the rows should usually be made about 6 to 8 feet apart.
On very light land the hills may be 4 feet apart in the row; on heavier land,
6 to 8 feet apart. As a general rule three seeds are planted to the hill, and
not less than two should be planted. One bushel of medium-sized seed should
plant from 5 to 6 acres. When the plants are from 4 to 6 inches tall, the
weaker ones should be removed, leaving one plant in a hill.</p>

<p>The crop is cultivated similar to corn until the plants are large enough to
shade the ground. In case the field becomes foul with weeds and grass, some
hoeing may be necessary, but practically all the cultivation required can be
done with a horse-drawn weeder. Some varieties in which the beans pop out
when the hull is fully ripe are known locally as "poppers," and after the beans
begin to ripen, the field must be gone over every few days and the ripe beans
collected in order to avoid loss. Other varieties tend to retain the beans in
the hull after they are ripe. The climate affects the popping of the beans, and
a variety which shatters badly in one region may shatter very little when
grown in another.</p>

<p>In harvesting, a common method is to cut off the spikes with a knife and
collect them in large sacks. They are then hauled to a shelter of some kind
and allowed to dry until the pods will crush easily. Various methods are
used in thrashing castor beans. If the variety grown is one which "pops"
or drops its seeds when they are ripe, the spikes are sometimes piled on a hard
ground or plank floor fully exposed to the sun and furnished with sides of
boards or cloth 6 to 8 feet high to catch the beans as they pop out. In some
varieties mere drying does not cause the pods to open, and specially constructed
machines have been used to remove the beans from the pods. After
the beans have been thrashed or popped out, a fanning mill is used to separate
the hulls, chaff, and dirt from the beans, which are then sacked and stored
for market.</p>

<p>The yield varies greatly and will depend much upon cultural conditions, the
season, the variety grown, and the care exercised in harvesting and thrashing
the seeds. In Oklahoma the average yield of the popping varieties is said to be
8 to 10 bushels per acre. Yields up to 25 bushels per acre have been reported
for favorable conditions.</p>

<p>For some years prior to the war the farm price for castor beans was about $1
a bushel. Early in the war the increased demand for castor oil caused a sharp
advance in the price of the beans, which has gradually declined. In June,
1920, the wholesale market quotation was about $3 a bushel. The normal
market requirement in the United States for castor beans is about 1,000,000
bushels annually, but during the last year of the war nearly 3,000,000 bushels
were imported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"> 28 </a></span></p>

<p>In the United States castor beans are used in quantity only by manufacturers
of castor oil. In general, the equipment and operation of a castor-oil
mill resembles that of a cottonseed-oil mill or linseed-oil mill, but special and
expensive equipment is necessary for the proper extraction of the oil from castor
beans. The best grade of oil is obtained from the beans by hydraulic pressure.
An additional quantity of oil of lower grade is obtained by treating the press
cake with naphtha or some other volatile solvent. The pomace resulting from
the second extraction is used as a fertilizer for tobacco, corn, and other crops,
but because of a poisonous principle can not be used for cattle feeding unless
specially treated.</p>

<p>Owing to the heavy outlay required for the necessary machinery and the
high cost of manufacture on a small scale, it has not been found profitable for
the growers of castor beans to undertake the extraction of the oil.</p>

<p>The castor-oil plant is not known to be poisonous, and although the leaves
are not relished by farm animals they are said to be used as fodder for cattle
in India. Castor beans, however, contain a poisonous principle, and though
harmless when handled, may cause serious if not fatal effects when eaten,
especially in the case of small children. Care should be taken to prevent
these beans from being accidentally mixed with the grain fed to animals,
since many cases have been reported in which the death of horses has been due
to eating feed in which they have become mixed.</p>

<h2><a name="CATNIP" id="CATNIP">CATNIP.</a></h2>


<p>Catnip (<i>Nepeta cataria</i>) is a European perennial plant of the mint family,
which frequently occurs in this country as a weed in gardens and about dwellings.
It has long had a popular use as a domestic remedy. Both leaves and
flowering tops find some demand in the crude-drug trade.</p>

<p>Catnip does well on almost any good soil, but thrives best on a well-drained
and moderately rich garden loam. However, a more fragrant and attractive
herb can be grown in sandy situations than in heavy soils. The plant may be
propagated from seeds or by root division. The seed may be sown in rows
either late in the fall or in early spring and covered lightly. Fall-sown seed
usually gives a more even stand and a heavier growth of herb. When the
plants have reached a height of 4 to 5 inches they should be thinned to stand
from 12 to 16 inches apart in the rows. In some localities the field sowing of
seed does not give good results, in which case plants may be started in a coldframe
and later transplanted to the field. Shallow cultivation will favor a
vigorous growth of the herb.</p>

<p>The flowering tops are harvested when the plants are in full bloom and are
dried in the shade to preserve their green color. In case the herb is grown in
large quantity, it may be cut with a mowing machine, the cutter bar of which
should be set high. The plants should lie in the swath until partially dry, and
the curing may then be finished either in small cocks in the field or in the barn,
care being taken to preserve the natural green color as far as possible.</p>

<p>Returns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about 2,000 pounds
of dried flowering tops per acre may be expected under good conditions. The
herb must be carefully sorted and all the large or coarse stems removed, after
which it may be made up for the market in bales of 100 to 300 pounds each.
Prewar prices to collectors ranged from 2 to 4 cents a pound. The prices in
June, 1920, for the herb were 5 cents; for the leaves, 10 cents; and for the
leaves and flowers, 14 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="CONIUM" id="CONIUM">CONIUM.</a></h2>


<p>Conium, or poison hemlock (<i>Conium maculatum</i>), is a large, poisonous European
biennial plant of the parsley family, naturalized in the Northeastern
States and in California. The full-grown but unripe seeds (fruits) and the
leaves are used medicinally.</p>

<p>Conium is easily grown, and has been found to thrive in both comparatively
moist clay soil and in dry sandy loam. In rich, moist land it may easily become
a troublesome weed. Conium grows readily from seed, which may be sown
either in the fall or early in the spring in drills 2 or more feet apart. As soon
as the seedlings can be distinguished in the row, cultivation similar to that
given ordinary garden crops is begun. The plants usually blossom in the second
year, and when the oldest seeds are full grown but still green in color the
plants are harvested and the seed at once thrashed out and dried with the least
possible exposure to the light. The small and undeveloped seed should be
screened out and rejected and the good seed stored in containers that will
exclude light and air. The leaves are collected when the plant is in flower,
quickly dried in the sun, and stored in the same manner as the seed.</p>

<p>Estimated yields at the rate of 600 to 800 pounds of seed per acre have been
obtained, but the yield is very uncertain, since the flowering plants are especially
subject to the attacks of insects which destroy the crop of seed. The
prewar prices as quoted in the wholesale drug markets ranged from 5 to 10
cents a pound for the seed and 5 to 6 cents for the leaves. The prices in
June, 1920, for the seed were 35 to 36 cents, and for the leaves 25 to 26 cents
a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="CORIANDER" id="CORIANDER">CORIANDER.</a></h2>


<p>Coriander (<i>Coriandrum sativum</i>) is an Old World annual of the parsley
family. For years the plant has been cultivated in gardens in the United States,
and it is now reported as growing wild in many places. The aromatic seeds
and the oil distilled from them have long been used medicinally. Both the
seed and the oil are also used for flavoring confectionery and cordials and as a
condiment in bread and cake.</p>

<p>Coriander grows well on almost any good soil, but thrives best on deep and
fertile garden loam. The soil should be well prepared before planting, which
should be done moderately early in the spring. For field cultivation the seed is
sown in rows 3 feet apart, but if the cultivation is done by hand the distance
between the rows may be reduced to 18 inches. The seed should be sown
thickly in order to insure a good stand. When well up, the plants are thinned
to stand 4 or 5 inches apart in the row. Cultivation should continue until the
plants flower, which will be about two months from the time of planting.</p>

<p>When most of the seeds are ripe the plants are cut with a scythe or mower,
preferably early in the morning while moist with dew, in order to avoid shattering
the seed. The plants are partially cured in small cocks in the field, the
drying being finished in a barn loft or under other suitable shelter, after which
the seeds are thrashed out and cleaned.</p>

<p>The yield of seed is quite variable, but returns from experimental areas indicate
that from 500 to 800 pounds per acre may be expected. Five hundred
pounds of seed will usually yield from 1 to 5 pounds of oil, according to the
localities where grown. The annual importation of coriander seed is about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"> 30 </a></span>
1,400,000 pounds. The prewar price of the seed was about 3 cents a pound;
in June, 1920, 3 to 4 cents. The wholesale price of the oil of coriander, which
was $5 to $7 a pound before the war, in June, 1920, ranged from $42 to $45 a
pound.</p>

<h2><a name="DANDELION" id="DANDELION">DANDELION.</a></h2>


<p>Dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>) is a well-known and troublesome perennial
weed, occurring abundantly almost everywhere in this country except in the
Southern States. It is frequently cultivated in market gardens for the leaves,
which are used for greens or salads, but the root alone is used in medicine.</p>

<p>This plant will grow well in any good soil and has been successfully cultivated
in the South, but in the colder parts of the country it may require slight
mulching during the winter if the roots tend to heave out of the soil. The seeds,
which are sown in the spring, are drilled in rows 18 inches apart and covered
one-half inch deep. About 3 pounds of seeds should sow an acre. The seedlings
are thinned to stand a foot apart in the row, and the crop should be well
cultivated and kept free from weeds.</p>

<p>The roots are dug in the fall of the second season after planting the seed.
They should be washed and may be dried whole, or, to facilitate handling and
drying, they may be cut into pierces 3 to 6 inches long and the larger, portions
sliced. Under favorable conditions, yields at the rate of 1,000 to 1,500 pounds of
dry roots per acre have been obtained from second-year plants. The prices
usually offered collectors for the dry root before the war ranged from 4 to 10
cents a pound. The price in June, 1920, was about 16 cents. The quantity
annually imported into this country varies from year to year, but averages
about 40 tons.</p>

<p>A serious disadvantage attending the cultivation of this crop is the danger
of seeding adjacent land with a very undesirable weed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="DIGITALIS" id="DIGITALIS">DIGITALIS.</a></h2>


<p>Digitalis, or foxglove (<i>Digitalis purpurea</i>), is a fairly hardy European perennial,
which has long been grown in flower gardens in this country as an ornamental
plant. The leaves are used in medicine, those from plants of the second
year's growth being required for the official drug.</p>

<p>Digitalis thrives in ordinary well-drained garden soils of open texture and
reasonable fertility. Sowing the seed directly in the field occasionally gives
good results, but is so often unsuccessful that it can not be recommended. The
seeds are exceedingly small and do not germinate well except under the most
favorable conditions. They should be mixed with sand, to insure even distribution
in seeding, and sown as early as February in seed pans or flats in the
greenhouses or in well-protected frames. When danger of frost is past the
plants should be hardened off and transplanted to the field, where they may be
set about a foot apart in rows spaced conveniently for cultivation.</p>

<p>The plants do not flower until the second year, and it is necessary to cultivate
them frequently during the growing seasons of both the first and second year.
In localities where the cold weather is severe it may be desirable to protect
the plants during the first winter with a light mulch of straw or coarse farmyard
manure.</p>

<p>The plants usually flower in June of the second year, and the leaves may then
be collected. They are carefully dried in the shade and should be stored in
such a manner that they will not be exposed to light and moisture. The results
of experiments indicate that yields of 450 to 600 pounds of dry leaves per
acre may be obtained under favorable conditions. In considering digitalis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"> 31 </a></span>
culture it should be borne in mind that the crop occupies the soil for the
greater part of two seasons and demands even closer attention than many
truck or garden crops.</p>

<p>In 1919 small areas of cultivated digitalis, ranging from one-half to 1 acre
in extent, were harvested in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Washington, California,
and some other States. Several tons of digitalis leaves were also collected
from plants of wild growth in the general region of the Coast Range of
mountains on the Pacific coast. Digitalis is of great medicinal importance,
but on account of its potency is administered in very small quantities; consequently,
a few thousand pounds is sufficient to meet the annual market requirements.
Before the war the price for digitalis leaves averaged about 15
cents a pound; in June, 1920, it was about 35 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="DILL" id="DILL">DILL.</a></h2>


<p>Dill (<i>Anethum graveolens</i>) is an Old World annual or biennial herb of the
parsley family. Although it is a native of southern Europe, it is hardy
plant and may be grown in a much cooler climate if given a warm situation
and a well-drained soil. The leaves are used for seasoning, and the seeds
(fruits), which are greatly valued for flavoring pickles, are used as a condiment
and occasionally in medicine. A volatile oil distilled from the seeds is
used chiefly for perfuming soap.</p>

<p>Dill is preferably grown as an annual plant, in which case the seed should
be sown about one-half inch deep very early in the spring in drills a foot
apart. A half ounce of seed is sufficient to sow 150 feet of drill, and at this
rate a pound should sow an acre. When sown in the field the rows may be
15 to 18 inches apart, and the seedlings should be thinned to stand about a
foot apart in the row. The most favorable soil is a well-prepared loam, but
the plants grow well in any good garden soil. Frequent cultivation and freedom
from weeds are essential for good results.</p>

<p>Early in the fall, as soon as some of the older seeds are ripe, the plants are
mowed and built up; into small cocks in the field, or, if sufficiently dry, the
seeds may be thrashed out at once. In very dry weather it is preferable to
mow the plants early in the morning while they are moist with dew, in order
to avoid shattering the seed. In case the seed is very ripe, it is well to cut
the plants high and to place the tops directly on large canvas sheets, in which
they may be brought from the field. After thrashing, the seeds should be
spread out in a thin layer and turned frequently until thoroughly dry, since
they tend to become musty if closely stored before all the moisture has been
removed.</p>

<p>The yield of dill seed is quite variable and is much influenced by climatic
conditions. From 500 to 700 pounds of seed per acre is considered a good yield.
The wholesale price in June, 1920, ranged from 8 to 11 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="ECHINACEA" id="ECHINACEA">ECHINACEA.</a></h2>


<p>Echinacea (<i>Brauneria angustifolia</i>, <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) is a native perennial plant of the
aster family found on the prairies of the Middle West, occurring most abundantly
in Nebraska and Kansas. The roots of the plant are used medicinally.</p>

<p>This plant has been found to do well under, cultivation in moderately rich
and well-drained loam. It grows fairly well from seeds, which may be collected
when ripe and kept dry until ready for use. Plants should be started in a well-prepared
seed bed by sowing the seeds thinly in drills about 8 inches apart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> 32 </a></span>
The plants develop slowly and may be left in the seed bed for two years and
then transplanted to the field in the spring and set about 18 inches apart In
rows. Thorough cultivation is essential for the best results. The roots do
not reach a marketable size under three or four years from the time of sowing
the seed. They are harvested in the fall, freed from any adhering soil, and
dried either in the open air or by means of low artificial heat.</p>

<p>Echinacea has not been cultivated on
a scale large enough to give satisfactory
data on the probable yield. The
prewar wholesale price ranged from 22
to 60 cents a pound; in June, 1920, it
was 60 to 65 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="ELECAMPANE" id="ELECAMPANE">ELECAMPANE.</a></h2>


<p>Elecampane (<i>Inula helenium</i>) Is a
European perennial plant of the aster
family, now growing wild along roadsides
and in fields throughout the
northeastern part of the United States.
The root is used in medicine.</p>

<p>Elecampane will grow in almost any
soil, but thrives best in deep clay loam
well supplied with moisture. The
ground on which this plant is to be
grown should be deeply plowed and
thoroughly prepared before planting.
It is preferable to use divisions of old
roots for propagation, and these should
be set in the fall about 18 inches apart in rows 3 feet apart. Plants may also be
grown from seeds, which may be sown in the spring in seeds beds and the seedlings
transplanted later to the field and set in the same manner as the root divisions.
Plants grown from seed do not flower the first year. Cultivation should
be sufficient to keep the soil in good condition and free from weeds.</p>

<p>The roots are dug in the fall of the second year, thoroughly cleaned, sliced,
and dried in the shade. The available data on yield indicate that a ton or more
of dry root per acre may be expected. The price to producers usually ranges
from 3 to 6 cents a pound. Upward of 50,000 pounds of elecampane root were
annually imported into this country prior to the war.</p>

<h2><a name="FENNEL" id="FENNEL">FENNEL.</a></h2>


<p>Fennel (<i>Foeniculum vulgare</i>) is an Old World perennial plant of the parsley
family, occasionally cultivated as a garden herb in the United States. The
aromatic seeds (fruits) are used in medicine and for flavoring. The oil distilled
from the seeds is used in perfumery and for scenting soaps.</p>

<p>Fennel grows wild in mild climates in almost any good soil and thrives in
rich, well-drained loams containing lime. It is propagated from seeds, which
may be sown in the open as soon as the ground is ready for planting in the
spring. The seed is sown thickly In drills 2 to 3 feet apart and covered lightly.
From 4 to 5 pounds of seed should sow an acre. When well established the
plants may be thinned to stand 12 to 15 inches apart in the row. Plants may
also be started in a seed bed from seed sown either in drills 6 inches apart or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"> 33 </a></span>
broadcast. When the seedlings are three or four inches high they are transplanted
to the field and set 12 to 15 inches apart in rows. The cultivation is the
same as for ordinary garden crops.</p>

<p>Frequently, very little seed is formed the first year, but full crops may be
expected for one or two succeeding years. The seed is gathered in the fall
before it is fully ripe and may be harvested like anise or coriander. A yield
of 600 to 800 pounds of seed, per acre may be expected. During recent years
about 275,000 pounds of seed have been imported annually. Owing to the war,
prices for the seed and oil have about doubled. The prices in June, 1920, for
the seed were 11 to 12 cents a pound; for the oil, $2.75 to $3 a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="GENTIAN" id="GENTIAN">GENTIAN.</a></h2>


<p>The common or yellow gentian (<i>Gentiana lutea</i>) is the only species recognized
in American medicine, although the roots of several other species are found
in the drug trade. The plant grows wild in the mountains of central and southern
Europe, but it has proved very poorly adapted for cultivation in situations
beyond its natural range. For its best development under cultivation, partial
shade, similar to that required by ginseng and goldenseal, seems necessary.
The plants are said to flower when about 6 years old; hence, several years
must elapse after sowing the seed before the roots reach a marketable size.
Apparently there have been no attempts to cultivate gentian commercially in
this country. The prewar wholesale price of imported gentian root ranged
from 4 to 8 cents a pound. The price in June. 1920, was 12 to 13 cents
a pound.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="GINSENG" id="GINSENG">GINSENG.</a></h2>


<p>Ginseng (<i>Panax quinquefolium</i>) is a fleshy-rooted herbaceous plant native
to this country and formerly of frequent occurrence in shady, well-drained situations
in hardwood forests from Maine to Minnesota and southward to the
mountains of Georgia and the Carolinas. It has long been valued by the Chinese
for medicinal use, though rarely credited with curative properties by natives
of other countries. When placed under cultural conditions, ginseng
should be shielded from direct sunlight by the shade of trees or by lath sheds.
The soil should be fairly light and well fertilized with woods earth, rotted
leaves, or fine raw bone meal, the latter applied at the rate of 1 pound to each
square yard. Seed should be planted in the spring as early as the soil can be
worked to advantage, placed 6 inches apart each way in the permanent beds
or 2 by 6 inches in seed beds, and the seedlings transplanted to stand 6 to 8
inches apart when 2 years old. Only cracked or partially germinated seed
should be used.</p>

<p>Ginseng needs little cultivation, but the beds should at all times be kept free
from weeds and grass and the surface of the soil slightly stirred whenever it
shows signs of caking. A winter mulch over the crowns is usually essential, but
it should not be applied until freezing weather is imminent and should be removed
in the spring before the first shoots come through the soil.</p>

<p>The roots do not reach marketable size until about the fifth or sixth year
from seed. When dug they should be carefully washed or shaken free from all
adhering soil, but not scraped. Curing is best; effected in a well-ventilated room
heated to about 90 F. Nearly a month is required to properly cure the larger
roots, and great care must be taken in order to prevent molding or souring.
Overheating must also be avoided. When well cured the roots should be stored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"> 34 </a></span>
in a dry, airy place until ready for sale. A market may be found with the
wholesale drug dealers, some of whom make a specialty of buying ginseng root
for export.</p>

<p>The price of cultivated ginseng roots, as quoted in wholesale drug lists, ranges
from $1.50 to $8 a pound, according to quality and freedom from disease.</p>

<p>Further details respecting the culture of ginseng are given in a Farmers'
Bulletin now in press, entitled "Ginseng Culture," and in Farmers' Bulletin
736, entitled "Ginseng Diseases and Their Control."</p>

<h2><a name="GOLDENSEAL" id="GOLDENSEAL">GOLDENSEAL.</a></h2>


<p>Goldenseal (<i>Hydrastis canadensis</i>) is a native perennial, formerly quite
abundant in open woodlands having ample shade, natural drainage, and an
abundance of leaf mold. Its range is from southern New York and Ontario
west to Minnesota and south to Georgia and Kentucky.</p>

<p>When grown under cultivation the soil should be well fertilized, preferably
by decaying vegetable matter, such as woods soil and rotting forest leaves,
which should be well worked in to a depth of 10 inches or more. Raw bone
meal and cottonseed meal are also favorable in their action. Seed may be
sown in October in a well-prepared seed bed. It may be scattered broadcast
or dropped one-half inch apart and covered with fine leaf mold to the depth
of 1 inch. During the winter the seed bed should be protected with burlap or
fertilizer sacks, and should also be guarded against encroachment of moles or
mice. Plants may be set 6 to 8 inches apart each way and the rootstocks covered
to a depth of about 2 inches. For satisfactory growth goldenseal requires
about 75 per cent of shade during the summer, which should be provided by a
lath shade or by cloth, brush, or vines. The soil should be kept free from
weeds and the plants liberally watered throughout the growing season, but
good drainage is necessary, since goldenseal does not thrive in boggy ground.</p>

<p>Under favorable conditions goldenseal reaches its best development in about,
five years from seed, or, in a year or two less when grown from root buds or
by divisions of the rootstocks. The root is dug in the autumn after the tops
have withered. They are washed clean of all soil, sticks, etc., and dried on
lath screens in an airy place in mild sunlight or partial shade, or indoors on
a clean, dry floor. When dried in the open they should be protected from rain
and dew. The cured root is kept in loose masses until marketed, since close
packing may cause attacks of mold. The dried leaves and stems of goldenseal,
commonly known as "seal herb," are also a marketable product.</p>

<p>The prices in June, 1920, ranged from $5 to $6 a pound for the roots and
from 40 to 70 cents a pound for the herb.</p>

<h2><a name="HENBANE" id="HENBANE">HENBANE.</a></h2>


<p>Henbane (<i>Hyoscyamus niger</i>) is a poisonous annual or biennial herb of the
nightshade family, introduced into this country from Europe and occasionally
found as a weed in a number of the Northern States. The leaves, flowering
tops, and sometimes the seeds are used medicinally.</p>

<p>Henbane is propagated from seeds, but when these are sown in the open
field germination is uncertain, and a very poor stand or total failure is a frequent
result. Germination is usually much more certain when the seeds are
sown under glass, but the plants do not readily stand transplanting and often
die after they are set in the open. Very good results have been secured by
sowing the seed in small pots under glass in January, transferring the seedlings
to 3-inch pots in March, and transplanting in May to the field, where the plants
may be set at least 15 inches apart in rows. In handling the plants care should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> 35 </a></span>
be taken to disturb the soil about the roots as little as possible. The soil
requirements and method of cultivation are practically the same as for belladonna.</p>

<p>The leaves of henbane usually suffer severely from attacks of the potato
beetle, especially during the first year, and the crop is very likely to be destroyed
if grown within the range of this insect.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the plants blossom about August of the second year and die after
ripening their seed, but individual plants started early frequently bloom and
set seed the first year. The leaves and flowing tops are collected when the
plants are in full bloom and are carefully dried in the shade.</p>

<p>The American crop of henbane has never much exceeded 10 acres. The yield
under favorable conditions is estimated at about 6,000 pounds per acre. The
wholesale price in June, 1920, was 35 to 38 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="HOREHOUND" id="HOREHOUND">HOREHOUND.</a></h2>


<p>Horehound (<i>Marrubium vulgare</i>) is a hardy perennial herb of the mint
family, which occurs as a common weed in many places in the United States,
especially on the Pacific coast, where it threatens to become a pest. The leaves
and flowering tops find some demand as a crude drug. Their greatest use,
however, is in the manufacture of candy, although they are sometimes employed
for seasoning.</p>

<p>Horehound grows well in almost any soil and thrives in light, dry soils lacking
in fertility. It grows readily from seeds, which are usually sown in drills
early in the spring and covered with about an inch of soil. Plants may also
be started in coldframes, either from seed or cuttings, and later transplanted
to the field. Propagation may also be effected by division of old plants. Plants
may stand 6, 12, or 18 inches apart in the row; those which stand close together
will have small stems, and hence will yield a crop of finer quality.</p>

<p>The plants are harvested just before flowering and should be cured in the
shade in order to preserve the green color. If the stems are small, the plants
may be cut close to the ground with a scythe, or with a mower if the area is
large. In case the plants are tall and large they must be cut some distance
above the ground and all coarse stems removed to make the herb suitable for
marketing.</p>

<p>Yields at the rate of 2,000 pounds of dry herb per acre have been obtained.
The prewar wholesale prices for the herb ranged from 5 to 8 cents a pound.
The price in June, 1920, was 15 to 16 cents. The annual importation of horehound
varies from year to year, sometimes reaching 60 to 70 tons.</p>

<h2><a name="INSECT-POWDER_FLOWERS" id="INSECT-POWDER_FLOWERS">INSECT-POWDER FLOWERS.</a></h2>


<p>Insect flowers, from which pyrethrum or insect powder is prepared, are produced
by several species of plants of the aster family which occur wild in the
eastern Mediterranean region, where they are also cultivated.</p>

<p>The species here considered (<i>Chrysanthemum</i> [<i>Pyrethrum</i>] <i>cinerariaefolium</i>)
has been cultivated commercially in California for the production of insect
powder. This species seems to thrive best in warm situations and should grow
well in any good soil which is well drained and not too heavy. The seeds may
be sown directly in the field, either early in the spring or in the fall, but it is
preferable to start the plants in coldframes or well-prepared seed beds and
transplant them to the field. The seed is mixed with sand and sown broadcast
on the surface of the bed and lightly covered with a rake. Water should be
used sparingly on the seed bed, since the young seedlings and even mature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> 36 </a></span>
plants are easily killed by a wet soil. When the seedlings are about a month
old they are transplanted, during damp weather if possible, and set 8 to 12
inches apart in rows 3 to 4 feet apart. Old plants may also be divided and
used for propagation. The plants should be well cultivated during the growing
season and will yield flowers for several years if they are well cared for. The
fertility of the soil is maintained by the application of fertilizers.</p>

<p>The time of harvesting varies from June to September, according to locality.
The flower heads are gathered just as they open and may be collected by
hand or by means of a flower picker. They are dried, preferably in the shade,
on canvas sheets about 15 feet square, on which they are spread in a thin
layer and turned two or three times a day until dry.</p>

<p>The average yield of dried flowers appears to be about 450 pounds per acre.
The wholesale price for these flowers in June, 1920, was 85 to 90 cents a pound,
which is from three to four times the prewar price.</p>

<h2><a name="LARKSPUR" id="LARKSPUR">LARKSPUR.</a></h2>


<p>The larkspur of the crude-drug trade is an annual plant (<i>Delphinium consolida</i>),
native of southern Europe, which has long been cultivated in this
country as an ornamental and is now occasionally found growing wild. Another
species of larkspur (<i>Delphinium urceolatum</i>) is native to this country and is
said to have properties very similar to those of the European species. Larkspur
seed is now used chiefly in remedies for external parasites.</p>

<p>These larkspurs thrive best in a rich sandy or gravelly soil. In heavy soils
they are likely to suffer from root-rot, which materially reduces the yield. A
rather dry climate is suitable for plants of this character. They do not
bear transplanting well and seeds should be sown in the fall or very early in
the spring where the plants are to stand. The soil should be well fined and
the seed thinly sown in drills spaced according to the method of cultivation
to be used. When up, the plants should be thinned to stand 8 inches or more
apart in the rows. The necessary cultivation consists in keeping the soil between
the rows and about the plants mellow and free from weeds during the
growing season.</p>

<p>When the seed capsules are fairly ripe, the seed is harvested by collecting
the tops, which should be cut before the seed capsules have become so brittle as
to risk the loss of seed by shattering and which can be handled best in the early
morning while damp and pliable. They should be cured in a well-ventilated
place, sheltered from rain, and when thoroughly dry may be thrashed out and
cleaned.</p>

<p>The wholesale price now quoted for larkspur seed is between 32 and 35 cents
a pound.</p>

<p>The seed of a European species of larkspur (<i>Delphinium staphisagria</i>), commonly-called
stavesacre, possesses medicinal properties and is recognized as
an official drug. The wholesale price for stavesacre seed in June, 1920, was
about 30 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="LAVENDER" id="LAVENDER">LAVENDER.</a></h2>


<p>The true lavender (<i>Lavandula vera</i>) is a small shrubby plant of the mint
family, native to southern Europe, and widely cultivated for its fragrant
flowers and for the oil distilled from the fresh flowering tops.</p>

<p>Lavender thrives best in light and rather dry soils well supplied with lime,
but may be grown in almost any well-drained loam. On low or wet land it is
almost certain to winterkill. The plant is not easily grown from seed, but may
be readily propagated from cuttings or by division. In cold climates the plants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> 37 </a></span>
must be well protected during the winter, or they may be carried over in a
greenhouse or coldframe. Early in the spring the plants or rooted cuttings are
set in well-prepared soil, 12 to 15 inches apart in rows spaced to suit the
cultivation intended. Frequent and thorough cultivation is desirable.</p>

<p>Not many blooms can be cut the first year, but full crops may be expected for
each of the three following years, after which it will be best to start new
plantings. The flowering tops are harvested when they are in full bloom, and
if used for the production of oil are distilled at once without drying. If the
dry flowers are wanted, the tops are carefully dried in the shade and the flowers
later stripped from the stems by hand.</p>

<p>On ordinary soil, yields of 600 to 1,200 pounds per acre of fresh flowering
tops have been obtained. The dry weight is about four-fifths of the green
weight. The yield of oil varies widely, but from 12 to 15 pounds per acre may
be expected under good conditions. The wholesale prices in June, 1920,
were about as follows: For "ordinary" flowers, from 18 to 24 cents a pound;
for "select" flowers, from 30 to 35 cents a pound; for oil of lavender flowers,
$11 to $12 a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="LICORICE" id="LICORICE">LICORICE.</a></h2>


<p>Licorice (<i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i>) is an Old World plant, the culture of which
has not succeeded commercially in this country, although the plant grows well
in the arid Southwest and in California, where in some localities it threatens
to become a weed. Licorice is used to some extent in medicine, and is said to
be much in demand by manufacturers of tobacco.</p>

<p>Licorice is a fairly hardy plant, but it thrives best in warm regions, where
the season is sufficiently long to promote strong growth. Plants may be grown
from seed, but propagation by means of cuttings made from the younger parts
of the Rhizome, or so-called root, usually gives best results. The cuttings are
set perpendicularly in deep, moist, sandy, or loamy soil, and should stand
about 18 inches apart in rows so spaced as to allow for the cultivation necessary
to keep the soil mellow and free from weeds.</p>

<p>The yield under good culture is said to average about 5,000 pounds of dry
root per acre at the end of every third year. The relatively low price at which,
the imported root can usually be obtained has so far prevented the development
of commercial licorice growing in this country. Nearly 100,000,000
pounds of licorice root and an average of about 600,000 pounds of licorice paste
are annually imported into the United States when trade conditions are normal.</p>

<p>Prewar prices for the imported root usually ranged from 4 to 5 cents a
pound in bales. The price in June, 1920, was 13 to 14 cents.</p>

<h2><a name="LOBELIA" id="LOBELIA">LOBELIA.</a></h2>


<p>Lobelia (<i>Lobelia inflata</i>) is a native poisonous annual plant, occurring generally
in open woods and pastures, but is most abundant in the States east of
the Mississippi River. The leaves, tops, and seeds are used medicinally.</p>

<p>This plant thrives under cultivation in a rather rich, moist loam, and grows
well either in the open or in partial shade. It grows readily from seeds, which
are very small and must be sown on soil which has been well fined and exceptionally
well prepared. The seeds are sown either in the fall or spring in
rows 2 feet apart. It is best not to cover the seeds but to sow them on the
surface of the soil, which is then firmed with a float or by resting a board over
the row and walking upon it. Fall planting usually gives a better stand and
a heavier crop. Shallow cultivation should be given until the plants begin to
flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"> 38 </a></span></p>

<p>Lobelia is harvested when in full flower or as soon as some of the older seed
pods are full grown. The plants may be cut with a mower if the cutter bar is
set high enough to avoid including the large stems. The herb should be dried
in the shade, in order to preserve the green color.</p>

<p>Small areas have given yields at the rate of 1,000 pounds of dry herb per
acre. The prewar price paid to collectors for the dried herb was about 3
cents a pound. The prices in June, 1920, were, for the herb, 20 cents; for the
seed, 75 cents a pound.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="LOVAGE" id="LOVAGE">LOVAGE.</a></h2>


<p>Lovage (<i>Levisticum officinale</i>) is a perennial plant of the parsley family, introduced
into this country from Europe as a garden plant and now grown as a
crop in certain localities in New England and the West. The root has long
been supposed to have medicinal properties and is in some demand in the drug
trade. The flowering tops yield a volatile oil, for which, however, there is
little demand. The seeds are used for flavoring confectionery and the leaf
stems are sometimes blanched, like celery, and eaten as a salad.</p>

<p>Lovage is propagated by division or from seeds. The seeds may be planted
in the fall in drills 18 inches apart or sown in early spring in a hotbed, greenhouse,
or well-prepared seed bed in a sheltered portion of the garden. They
should be covered very lightly with sand or fine sifted soil, and in order to
prevent the soil from drying out before the seeds germinate it is advisable to
spread old burlap or sacking over the bed. The sacking may be sprinkled occasionally
if the weather is dry and should be removed when the first seedlings
break the soil. The plants should reach a size suitable for transplanting by
the end of May, when they may be set at intervals of 8 inches in rows far
enough apart for convenient cultivation. Lovage grows well in almost any
deep, well-drained soil, such as will produce a fair crop of corn or potatoes, and
is benefited by the liberal use of fertilizer, although heavy applications of
manure tend to produce excessive top growth.</p>

<p>The roots may be dug in October of the second or third year after setting the
plants. Numerous offsets will generally be found, and if these have good roots
they may be used to renew the plantation without recourse to seed. Such
shoots should at once be reset at the usual distances apart. The freshly dug
roots should be well washed, cut into slices about one-half inch thick, and carefully
dried. If necessary, artificial heat, not to exceed 125 F., may be used to
hasten drying.</p>

<p>Returns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about 1,000 pounds
of dried root to the acre may be expected under good conditions every third
year. The prices quoted for American lovage root in the wholesale drug markets
range from 45 cents to $1 a pound, according to demand and quality.
Producers, however, usually receive much less than the wholesale price.</p>

<h2><a name="MELISSA" id="MELISSA">MELISSA.</a></h2>


<p>Melissa, balm, or lemon balm (<i>Melissa officinalis</i>), is a perennial herb of the
mint family, native to southern Europe. In this country it has long been
cultivated in gardens, from which it has escaped and now grows wild in many
places in the eastern United States. The leaves of balm are widely used for
culinary flavoring, and the leaves and flowering tops are used in medicine. The
volatile oil distilled from the plant is said to be used in perfumery and also for
flavoring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"> 39 </a></span></p>

<p>Balm grows readily on any good garden soil and is easily propagated from
seeds, cuttings, or by division. The seeds may be sown in the open early in
the spring, but owing to their small size it is best to sow them in shallow flats
in a greenhouse or in a hotbed. The soil should be well fined and the seeds
sown thinly on the surface of the soil, which is then firmed with a float or a
small board. When well up, the seedlings should be transferred to deeper
flats, and when 4 or 5 inches high they may be transplanted to the open and
set about a foot apart in rows spaced to suit the cultivation to be given.
Cultivation should be frequent and sufficient to keep the soil about the plants
mellow and free from weeds.</p>

<p>When the plants are in full flower the crop can be cut with a scythe, or
with a mower if the herb is to be used for distillation. For preparing the
crude drug only the flowering tops are collected, the coarse, stemmy portions
of the herb being rejected. The leaves and tops are dried in the shade in
order to preserve the green color.</p>

<p>Yields at the rate of about 1,800 pounds of dry herb per acre have been
obtained, but if only the flowering tops are collected the yield will be very
materially less. The prewar price paid to collectors for the leaves and tops
ranged from 3 to 4 cents a pound. In June, 1920, the price for the leaves was 15
cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="ORRIS" id="ORRIS">ORRIS.</a></h2>


<p>Orris (<i>Iris florentina</i>) is a perennial, native to southern Europe, and is cultivated
chiefly in Italy for its fragrant rootstocks, which yield the orris of
commerce. The plant grows well in a variety of soils and flourishes in a rich,
moist loam, but roots which are grown in rather dry, gravelly soil appear to be
the most fragrant. Orris is readily propagated by division of the old plants,
which may be set either in the spring or fall about a foot apart in rows spaced
conveniently for cultivation.</p>

<p>Since harvesting usually takes place only once in three years, the use of the
land is required for that length of time in order to obtain one crop. After the
roots are dug they are peeled and dried in the open air. The desired fragrance
does not develop until after the dry roots have been stored for a number of
months, during which time they are especially liable to the attacks of insects.</p>

<p>The yield is from 5 to 6 tons of dry root per acre. The average annual importation
of orris is normally about 500,000 pounds. The wholesale prices,
which before the war ranged from 6 to 10 cents, in June, 1920, were 14 to
15 cents a pound. The outlook for a profitable orris industry in this country
does not appear promising, and it does not seem advisable for any considerable
number of persons to undertake the growing of this crop.</p>

<h2><a name="PARSLEY" id="PARSLEY">PARSLEY.</a></h2>


<p>Parsley (<i>Petroselinum sativum</i>) is a biennial herb grown everywhere in gardens
for use in garnishing and seasoning. All parts of the plant contain a
volatile oil, that from the seed being especially rich in a constituent known as
apiol, or "parsley camphor," which is still used to some extent in medicine.
In the crude-drug trade there is a small demand for the root, leaves, and seed.</p>

<p>A rich and rather moist soil is desirable for the growing of parsley. The
seeds germinate slowly and are frequently sown early in the spring in cold
frames or seed beds, from which the young plants may be removed later and
set in the open in rows 12 or more inches apart and about 6 inches apart in the
row. When the leaves are fully grown they may be collected and dried in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> 40 </a></span>
usual manner. The plants flower in the second year, and as soon as the seed
is ripe it is harvested and carefully dried. At the end of the second growing
season, late in October, the root may be dug and should be well washed and
carefully dried. Artificial heat may be used in drying if necessary.</p>

<p>On small areas yields of seed at the rate of about 185 pounds per acre have
been obtained. During the past few years the wholesale price of the seed has
varied from 10 to 70 cents a pound, according to demand and season. From
15 to 50 pounds of seed are required to yield 1 pound of the oil, which in June,
1920, was quoted at $6.50 to $7 a pound.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="PENNYROYAL" id="PENNYROYAL">PENNYROYAL.</a></h2>


<p>Pennyroyal (<i>Hedeoma pulegioides</i>) is an annual plant, flowering from June
to October, and is found in dry soils from Nova Scotia and Quebec to Dakota
and southward. Both the dry herb and the oil obtained therefrom by steam
distillation form marketable products.</p>

<p>Pennyroyal grows well on average upland soils and is frequently abundant on
sandy or gravelly slopes. In field planting the seeds should be sown in rows
in the fall and covered not to exceed one-quarter of an inch, since they rarely
germinate if planted at a greater depth. The plants come up early in the
spring, and to secure the best results clean cultivation and freedom from weeds
are essential, as with all cultivated crops.</p>

<p>Early in the summer, when the plants are in full flower, they may be mowed.
To prepare the herb for market the plants are dried, preferably in the shade,
and carefully packed immediately after drying. All the large stems should be
removed in order to improve the quality of the product. The herb should be
marketed promptly, since it deteriorates with age. For the production of the
volatile oil, the plants should be harvested when in full flower and distilled
without drying.</p>

<p>Returns from experimental areas indicate that a yield of about 1,200 pounds
of dry herb per acre may be expected. The yield of oil varies from 15 to 30
pounds per acre. The price paid for the dry herb usually ranges from 1 to 2
cents a pound. The wholesale price of the oil ranges from about $1 to $2 a
pound.</p>

<h2><a name="PEPPERMINT" id="PEPPERMINT">PEPPERMINT.</a></h2>


<p>Peppermint (<i>Mentha piperita</i>) is a perennial of the mint family, frequently
found growing wild in moist situations throughout the eastern half of the
United States. It is cultivated on a commercial scale, chiefly on the muck
lands of southern Michigan and northern Indiana. The volatile oil forms the
principal marketable product, but there is some demand in the crude-drug trade
for the dried leaves and flowering tops.</p>

<p>Peppermint is propagated from "roots," or runners, which should be set
in an almost continuous row in furrows about 3 feet apart and covered to a
depth of about 3 inches. It can be grown on any land that will produce good
crops of corn, but is most successful on the muck lands of reclaimed swamps.
On uplands it soon exhausts the soil and will not do well for more than two or
three seasons without the rotation of crops. On rich muck lands it will grow
for a number of years, the soil being plowed after the crop is harvested and
the runners turned in to form a new growth the succeeding year. It is essential
that the ground be kept free from weeds, since their presence in the crop at
harvest would seriously injure the quality of the oil.</p>

<p>When peppermint is grown on reclaimed swamps or muck lands fertilizers
are rarely needed, but on uplands it is well to plow in 12 or more tons per acre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"> 41 </a></span>
of rotted stable manure before planting. Similar applications may be made
between the rows in early spring and plowed in as the land shows signs of
exhaustion. Commercial truck or potato fertilizers cultivated in between the
rows at the rate of 600 pounds to the acre have proved useful in keeping up
fertility, but manure is to be preferred, as it provides humus or vegetable
matter as well as increases the fertility.</p>

<p>Harvesting is begun in July or August, when the plants are in full bloom.
The herb is cut and cured like hay, and when fairly well dried is placed in large
vats or stills having a capacity of from 1 to 3 tons of dry herb and distilled
with steam to obtain the volatile oil. The yield of oil is exceedingly variable,
but on lands well suited for the production
of peppermint the average yield is not far
from 30 pounds per acre. The annual production
of peppermint oil in the United
States is about 300,000 pounds. For many
years before the war the price of the oil
varied from year to year, but averaged about
$2.50 a pound. There is some demand for the
dried leaves and tops, for which 6 to 15
cents a pound was paid to collectors in June,
1920.</p>

</div>

<p>Pinkroot (<i>Spigelia marilandica</i>, <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>) is a
native perennial herb occurring in rich open
woods from New Jersey to Wisconsin and
south to Florida and Texas. The root is an
official drug, the use of which has declined in
recent years, apparently on account of the
extent to which pinkroot has been adulterated with the worthless roots of
another plant known as East Tennessee pinkroot. Prospective growers of pinkroot
should obtain seeds or roots for planting from thoroughly reliable sources
only.</p>

<p>Pinkroot makes a vigorous growth under conditions suitable for growing
ginseng or goldenseal, and partial shade is usually necessary, although if given
a rich, moist, loamy soil it may be grown without shade in situations not too
hot and dry. It is propagated either from seeds or from divisions of old roots.
It is best to sow the seeds as soon as they are ripe, but if mixed with moist
sand and kept in a cool place sowing may be deferred until fall or the following
spring. The seeds are sown in drills 6 inches apart in well-prepared seed beds,
and in the spring, when the young plants are a few inches high, they are set
about a foot apart each way in the permanent beds. The old roots are divided
when dormant, and each division should consist of a portion of the root with
one or more buds and a number of the small rootlets. They are set in the same
manner as the seedlings. Thorough cultivation and freedom from weeds are
essential for good results.</p>

<p>The roots usually attain a marketable size in three years, but will give a
heavier yield at the end of the fourth or fifth year. They are harvested in the
fall, and after the tops are cut off the roots are well washed and thoroughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"> 42 </a></span>
dried. Little can be said regarding yield, but returns from small areas indicate
that a bed 4 by 30 feet will yield from 10 to 12 pounds of dry root in four years.
The prices paid to collectors of pinkroot before the war ranged from 15 to 30
cents a pound. The price in June, 1920, was about 60 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="POKEWEED" id="POKEWEED">POKEWEED.</a></h2>


<p>Pokeweed (<i>Phytolacca americana</i>) is a native plant of frequent occurrence in
moist, rich soil along fences and in uncultivated land throughout the eastern
half of the United States. The root, which is perennial, sends up large annual
stems, sometimes attaining a height of 8 or 9 feet. This plant bears numerous
long clusters of smooth, shining purple berries, very attractive in appearance,
but the seeds are said to be poisonous. Both the root and the berries are used
in medicine.</p>

<p>Pokeweed thrives in deep, rich soils well supplied with moisture and may be
readily grown from seed sown early in the spring in rows 4 feet apart and
barely covered. The seedlings may be thinned to stand about 3 feet apart in
the rows. Cultivation should be shallow, though frequent. The plant develops
a long, thick, and fleshy root, which when old is not easily harvested and may
have to be dug by hand. If the roots of plants grown from seed are harvested
at the end of the first year, they may be turned out by means of a deep-running
plow without great difficulty. As soon as they are dug the roots are cleaned
by washing and are usually cut into lengthwise or transverse slices for drying.
They should be thoroughly dried, and if a large quantity is to be handled the
use of artificial heat will be found desirable.</p>

<p>A yield of about 600 pounds of dry root per acre may be expected at the end
of the first year, or three or four times as much from plants of the second
year's growth. In the second year several hundred pounds of berries may also
be obtained from 1 acre.</p>

<p>Before the war, collectors received from 2 to 3 cents a pound for the roots
and berries. The price in June, 1920, for the dry, cut root was about 6
cents and for the dry berries 15 cents a pound. Apparently there is but a small
demand for either of these products.</p>

<h2><a name="SAFFLOWER" id="SAFFLOWER">SAFFLOWER.</a></h2>


<p>Safflower, American saffron, or false saffron (<i>Carthamus tinctorius</i>) is a
hardy Old World annual of the aster family, cultivated in gardens in this
country for its flowers, which are used in coloring or for flavoring, and sometimes
as a substitute for the true saffron.</p>

<p>Safflower grows well on moist soils and may be readily propagated from
seeds sown in the open early in the spring. The soil should be fine and mellow,
and the seeds sown an inch or more apart in drills and well covered. About
three weeks from the time of sowing the seed the plants will be well started,
and cultivation should begin at once and be continued until the flower buds
form. The plants bloom in July or August, when harvesting may begin. Only
the florets are collected, and, since these must be removed by hand, harvesting
is slow and expensive. The plants continue to blossom for several weeks, and
the florets must be harvested almost daily. It is best to collect them early in
the morning and to dry them in the shade on trays having muslin bottoms.
The florets should be turned daily until thoroughly dry and then stored in tin
containers.</p>

<p>The yield is estimated at 125 to 150 pounds of dry florets per acre. The
price for safflower is variable and ranges from 19 to 60 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="SAFFRON" id="SAFFRON">SAFFRON.</a></h2>


<p>The true saffron (<i>Crocus sativus</i>) is a low-growing, fall-blooming, bulbous
plant of the iris family, native to southern Europe, where it is cultivated commercially.
It was formerly grown as a small garden crop in some localities in
this country, chiefly in Lancaster and Lebanon Counties, Pa. The stigmas of
the flowers form the saffron of commerce. Saffron is used in cookery and for
coloring confectionery, and was formerly widely used in medicine.</p>

<p>A rich, well-drained garden soil favors a vigorous growth of the plant, but
a better quality of saffron is secured on land of medium fertility. It is propagated
from bulbs (corms), which may be planted in August about 6 inches
apart each way and 6 inches deep in well-prepared soil. When grown on a
large scale the bulbs are often set late in the spring. The ground is laid off
in rows about 20 inches apart, and a furrow 6 to 8 inches deep is opened for
each row. In this furrow the bulbs are set in two parallel rows about 4 inches
apart and about 2 inches apart in the row. The furrows are then filled and
the surface of the soil brought to a uniform level. Thorough cultivation and
freedom from weeds are essential for good results.</p>

<p>The purplish blossoms usually appear about October, but the main leaf growth
of the plant is made in the following spring. The bulbs may remain undisturbed
for three or four years, or they may be taken up yearly and the clusters
divided. All unsound bulbs should be rejected, as they are often attacked by
a fungus which readily spreads to the sound bulbs, causing them to rot. During
the blossoming period, which frequently lasts from two to three weeks, the
flowers are collected daily just as they open. The orange-colored stigmas are
then removed from the flowers, either by pulling them out or by cutting them
off with the finger nail, after which the flowers are thrown away. The stigmas
are dried immediately, a common method being to spread them in a thin layer
on a sieve which is suspended over a low fire. When fully dry they are placed
in linen bags and stored in a dry place.</p>

<p>The yield of saffron is variously estimated at from 10 to 30 pounds per
acre, according to the situation where it Is grown. About 50,000 flowers are required
to produce a pound of dry saffron; consequently, the amount of hand
labor involved in removing the stigmas is quite large. The price usually received
for saffron in normal times is not far from $8 a pound, but the prices in
June, 1920, ranged from $14 to $15 a pound. Owing to the high cost of
production, it is not thought probable that saffron culture would prove profitable
in the United States.</p>

<h2><a name="SAGE" id="SAGE">SAGE.</a></h2>


<p>The common sage plant (<i>Salvia officinalis</i>) is a hardy perennial of the mint
family, widely cultivated in gardens, and when once established it persists for
several years. The leaves are used extensively for seasoning meats and soups,
and a tea made from them is an old household remedy.</p>

<p>Sage is easily cultivated and will grow in any well-drained fertile soil, but
seems to thrive best in a rich clayey loam. For cultivation on a large scale
the seeds are sown in early spring in rows from 2 to 3 feet apart, and when the
plants are well up they are thinned to stand about 12 inches apart in the row.
Seedling plants have a tendency to produce narrow leaves; hence, the broad-leaved
varieties which do not flower readily are the most desirable, since they
give a larger yield of leaves. As the plants rarely set seed, they are usually
grown from cuttings, which may be obtained from seed houses having their
own propagating gardens. Cuttings set as early in the spring as weather conditions
will permit usually give a large crop. In the North the plants should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"> 44 </a></span>
be protected In winter by a mulch of manure. Sage may also be grown as a
second crop after early vegetables.</p>

<p>A fair crop of leaves may be harvested the first season and a much larger
one for five or six years following. Only one picking should be made the first
year, after which two or three pickings may be made in a season. If a product
of fine quality is desired, the leaves are picked by hand and dried in the shade.
Sage leaves are apt to turn black while drying unless the removal of moisture
proceeds continually until they are fully dry. A cheap grade may be obtained
at a smaller harvest cost by cutting the plants with a mower, the cutter bar of
which is set at such a height as not to include the woody stems. The dry herb
should be marketed promptly, since it loses its strength rapidly with age.</p>

<p>Returns from experimental areas indicate that on good soil a yield of 2,000
pounds or more of dried tops per acre may be expected. In case the leaves
only are harvested, the yield will be proportionately less. American leaf sage
usually brings a considerably higher price than that imported from Europe.
During the last three years the price has ranged from 20 to 70 cents a pound,
according to supply and demand.</p>

<h2><a name="SENECA_SNAKEROOT" id="SENECA_SNAKEROOT">SENECA SNAKEROOT.</a></h2>

<p>Seneca snakeroot, known also as senega or seneca root (<i>Polygala senega</i>,
<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>), is a small native perennial, occurring in rocky woods in the eastern
United States and Canada. Seneca is not yet grown on a commercial scale,
although cultivated experimentally in a number of places. The root is used in
medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"> 45 </a></span></p>

<p>Seneca can be grown in good garden soil or in rather firm, stony soil, provided
it contains a fair proportion of leaf mold or very well rotted manure. Shade
is not essential, although the plant thrives in partial shade or under modified
forest conditions. Roots for propagation may be obtained from dealers or may
be collected from the wild in autumn or early spring. If set 15 inches apart in
rows, the plants may be readily cultivated until they reach a marketable size.
The seeds ripen in June and may then be planted, or they may be stratified
by mixing with sand and buried in boxes or flower pots in moist soil until the
following spring, when they may be sown in seed beds or shallow boxes of loam
and leaf mold. The seedlings when old enough to be handled safely may be
transplanted to the permanent beds and set in rows to facilitate cultivation.
In cold situations they will probably need to be protected during the first winter
after transplanting. A light covering of straw or pine needles will be sufficient
to protect them from severe frost.</p>

<p>The plant is slow in growth, but experiments thus far indicate that about
four years are required to obtain marketable roots. The roots should be dug
in the fall, thoroughly cleaned, and dried. There are no reliable data on the
probable yield. Seneca root is in constant demand, and collectors formerly
received from 35 to 50 cents a pound. The price to collectors in June, 1920, was
90 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="SERPENTARIA" id="SERPENTARIA">SERPENTARIA.</a></h2>


<p>Serpentaria, or Virginia snakeroot (<i>Aristolochia serpentaria</i>), is a native
perennial plant occurring in rich woods in the eastern part of the United States,
and most abundantly along the Allegheny Mountains. The roots of this plant
are used in medicine.</p>

<p>Like many other woodland plants, serpentaria requires a rich, moist loam
and partial shade for its best development. It may be readily propagated from
seeds, which, however, require several months for germination. The seeds are
best sown in a well-prepared seed bed as soon as they are ripe. They may also
be sown broadcast or in drills 6 inches apart and lightly covered with leaf
mold. A thin mulch of straw or leaves will afford the necessary winter protection.
In the spring the plants may be set 6 inches apart each way in the
permanent beds. Plantings have been made in the open, in which case the
plants were set 4 inches apart in rows 16 inches apart, but the results have
been less satisfactory than with plantings made under shade.</p>

<p>The roots are collected in the fall, thoroughly cleaned, and carefully dried.
Satisfactory data on probable yields under cultivation are not available. The
price usually ranges from 30 to 45 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="SPEARMINT" id="SPEARMINT">SPEARMINT.</a></h2>


<p>Spearmint (<i>Mentha spicata</i>) is a well-known perennial of the mint family
which is very frequently found growing wild in moist situations throughout
the eastern half of the United States. It is widely used for seasoning meats,
and the leaves and flowering tops, as well as the volatile oil distilled from
the whole herb, form marketable drug products.</p>

<p>Spearmint is easily grown in any fertile soil which is fairly moist. Its
culture and the method of distilling the volatile oil are the same as for peppermint.
To prepare the dry herb for market the leaves and flowering tops are
collected when the first flowers appear and before the leaves begin to fall and
are carefully dried in the shade. The demand for the dry herb is small, but
the annual market requirement for the oil is about 50,000 pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"> 46 </a></span></p>

<p>On ordinary soils the yield of oil varies from 10 to 20 pounds per acre, according
to stand and season, but on muck lands the yield is usually only a little
less than that of peppermint. Before the war the wholesale prices for the oil
ranged from $1.50 to $5, averaging about $3.30 a pound. The price in June,
1920, was $12 a pound. The dry herb, which formerly brought from 3 to 4
cents, is now quoted at 6 to 12 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="STRAMONIUM" id="STRAMONIUM">STRAMONIUM.</a></h2>


<p>Stramonium, Jamestown weed, or jimson weed (<i>Datura stramonium</i>), is a
poisonous annual of the nightshade family, which occurs as a common weed
in almost all parts of this country except the West and North. The leaves and
seeds are used medicinally.</p>

<p>Although stramonium grows wild on a variety of soils, it thrives best under
cultivation in rich and rather heavy soils which are fairly well supplied with
lime. It grows readily from seed, which may be sown in the open early in the
spring in drills 3 feet apart and barely covered. When the plants are well
established they are thinned to stand 12 to 15 inches apart in the row. The
plants can be readily transplanted, and gaps occurring in the rows may be
filled in with the plants removed in thinning. Cultivation sufficient to keep the
soil free from weeds is necessary for good growth.</p>

<p>Cultivated plants are frequently attacked by leaf-eating insects, especially in
the early stages of growth, and it is often necessary to use lime or other insect
repellents to prevent the destruction of the crop.</p>

<p>The leaves, which are collected when the plant is in full bloom, may be picked
in the field, but time will be saved if the entire plant is cut and dried in an
artificially heated curing room at a temperature of 100 to 110 F. When the
leaves are dry they can be readily stripped from the stems, and should be baled
for shipment. Such seed as is ripe may be easily thrashed out of the capsules
after the leaves have been removed from the stems.</p>

<p>Yields of dry leaf at the rate of 1,000 to 1,500 pounds per acre have been
obtained. The yield of seed is much more variable, and is estimated to range
from 500 to 2,000 pounds per acre. The prewar price for the leaves varied from
2 to 10 cents and for the seed from 3 to 7 cents a pound. The price in June,
1920, for the leaves was 22 cents and for the seed 12 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="TANSY" id="TANSY">TANSY.</a></h2>


<p>Tansy (<i>Tanacetum vulgare</i>) is a European perennial plant, long cultivated in
this country in gardens, from which it has escaped, and it now occurs as a weed
along fence rows and roadsides. The leaves and flowering tops are in some
demand for medicinal purposes. The herb also yields a volatile oil, for which
there is a small market.</p>

<p>Tansy grows well on almost any good soil, but rich and rather heavy soils
well supplied with moisture favor a heavy growth of herb. It may be propagated
from seed, but is more readily propagated by division of the roots early
in spring. The divisions are set 18 inches apart in rows 3 feet apart. Seed
may be sown very early in the spring in the open or in seed beds, and the seedlings
later transplanted to the field. Such cultivation as is usually given to
garden crops will be sufficient.</p>

<p>The plants are cut late in the summer when in full flower, the leaves and
tops being separated from the stems and dried without exposure to the sun,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"> 47 </a></span>
as the trade desires a bright-green color. For the volatile oil the plants are
allowed to lie in the field after cutting until they have lost a considerable portion
of their moisture. They are then brought to the still and the oil removed
by the usual method of steam distillation.</p>

<p>A yield of about 2,000 pounds of dry leaves and flowering tops per acre may
be obtained under good conditions. The yield of oil varies, but about 20
pounds per acre is a fair average. In the United States the center of production
of oil of tansy is Michigan, where about 2,500 pounds are distilled annually.
The price of the oil in June, 1920, was about $8 a pound. The price of
the leaves and tops usually ranges from 3 to 5 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="THYME" id="THYME">THYME.</a></h2>


<p>Thyme (<i>Thymus vulgaris</i>) is a shrublike perennial plant of the mint family,
native to southwestern Europe. It is a common garden plant, which lives for
many years under good culture. The herb, often used for seasoning and flavoring,
yields the oil of thyme, which has well-recognized medicinal properties.</p>

<p>Thyme grows well from seed, which may be sown early in the spring in
drills 3 feet apart, or the plants may be started in a greenhouse or in seed beds
outside and later set at intervals of about 18 inches in rows 2 to 3 feet apart.
Thyme may also be propagated, like geraniums, from cuttings rooted in sand
under glass. The plants grow well in mellow upland soil of good quality, and
should be well cultivated and kept free from weeds throughout the growing
season.</p>

<p>For preparing the dry herb only the flowering tops are used, and these are
cut when the plant is in full bloom and carefully dried in the shade in order
to preserve the natural color. The volatile oil is obtained from the entire
herb, which is preferably cut when in full flower and subjected to steam
distillation without previous drying.</p>

<p>Returns from experimental areas have shown great variations in the yield,
which has averaged about a ton of green herb per acre. Normally the yield
from a planting increases for several years, as the plants become better established,
and yields at the rate of about a ton of dry herb per acre have been
reported. The wholesale price in June, 1920, for the dry herb ranged from 11
to 15 cents a pound; for the imported oil, from $1.85 to $2.25 a pound, according
to quality.</p>

<h2><a name="VALERIAN" id="VALERIAN">VALERIAN.</a></h2>


<p>Valerian (<i>Valeriana officinalis</i>) is a hardy herbaceous perennial, well known
under the name "garden heliotrope" and often grown as an ornamental plant.
It has also been cultivated as a drug plant in New York and in parts of New
England. The dried roots (rhizome and roots) form the marketable drug.</p>

<p>Valerian grows well in all ordinary soils, but thrives in a rich and rather
heavy loam which is well supplied with moisture. It may be readily propagated
by dividing the old roots, either in the fall or in the spring, and setting
the divisions about a foot apart in rows 2 to 3 feet apart. If the divisions are
set very early in the fall in time to become well established before frost, a
good crop may usually be harvested the following autumn. Plants may also
be grown from seed, which are preferably sown as soon as they are ripe in well-protected
seed beds in the garden. Early in the spring the seedlings may be
transplanted to the field and set at the same distances apart as the divisions of
the root. Growth will be favored by a liberal application of farmyard manure,
which should be well worked into the soil before the plants are set out. Thorough
cultivation is essential.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"> 48 </a></span></p>

<p>The roots of the plants propagated by division may be dug in the fall of the
first year's growth, although the yield will probably be small. Those of seedling
plants do not usually reach a size suitable for harvesting before the end
of the second growing season. After digging, the roots are washed, preferably
in running water, until all adhering soil is removed. Washing and drying will
be facilitated if the thick portion of the roots is sliced lengthwise. The drying
should be very thorough, and the use of artificial heat will be found advisable.</p>

<p>Under good conditions a yield of 2,000 pounds or more of dried roots per
acre may reasonably be expected. The prewar price ranged from 6 to 30 cents
a pound, depending upon the place where grown, that from England usually
commanding the highest price. The wholesale price in June, 1920, was about
22 cents a pound.</p>

<h2><a name="VETIVER" id="VETIVER">VETIVER.</a></h2>


<p>Vetiver, or cuscus grass (<i>Vetiveria zizanioides</i>), is a perennial of the grass
family, native to southern Asia. It is occasionally cultivated in this country
in the warmer portions of the Gulf Coast States as an ornamental and also
for its aromatic roots, which are often used to impart a fragrance to clothing.
In other countries an oil is distilled from the roots and used in the manufacture
of perfumes.</p>

<p>Vetiver will grow in almost any soil, but light, sandy soil enriched by farmyard
manure is to be preferred. Propagation is effected by dividing old
Clumps, which may be set in the field, either in the fall or spring, about 4 or 5
feet apart each way. During the growing season the plants are given sufficient
cultivation to keep them free from weeds. Vetiver grows in close bunches from
6 to 8 feet high, the numerous roots spreading horizontally about 2 feet on all
sides of the plant.</p>

<p>Harvesting the roots, which usually takes place in November, is a laborious
operation. The soil about the plants is opened with a stout, sharp spade in a
circle large enough to include most of the roots. The earth is then dug from
beneath the center of the plant and the entire clump lifted. The roots are
first beaten or shaken to free them from adhering soil, then cut off close to
the root crown and thoroughly washed. They may be dried in the open air,
but it is preferable to dry them in a closed room at a low temperature, since
they lose in fragrance if exposed to the hot sun or to a free circulation of air.</p>

<p>Yields at the rate of 600 to 1,000 pounds of dry roots per acre have been
obtained. The prices in the markets of New Orleans are said to range from 75
cents to $1 a pound. The oil is not produced commercially in this country.
The demand for both roots and oil is quite small, and it has not yet been
shown that vetiver would be a profitable crop in the United States.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="WINTERGREEN" id="WINTERGREEN">WINTERGREEN.</a></h2>


<p>Wintergreen (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>) is a low-growing, broad-leaved, evergreen
plant with a creeping stem. The shoots from this stem grow to a height
of 4 to 5 inches and bear solitary white flowers, which are followed by red
berries. These berries are edible and are widely known as teaberries or
checkerberries. Wintergreen is a common plant in woods and clearings from
eastern Canada southward to the Gulf States, but its collection in quantity is
somewhat difficult. Both the dry herb and the oil form marketable products.</p>

<p>Like other woodland plants, wintergreen thrives only in partial shade, and
plantings should be made in a grove or under a specially constructed shade,
such as is used for ginseng or goldenseal. A fairly good growth may be expected
in soil which is thoroughly mixed with leaf mold to a depth of 4 inches
or more. Wild plants may be used for propagation. Divisions of these may be
set in the fall or spring, about 6 inches apart each way, in permanent beds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"> 49 </a></span></p>

<p>Wintergreen is usually gathered in October or at the end of the growing season.
The plants are carefully dried and packed in bags or boxes for marketing.
For the production of the volatile oil the plants are soaked in water for about
24 hours and then distilled with steam. Over 22,000 pounds of wintergreen oil
were produced in this country in 1909 and 6,000 pounds in 1914.</p>

<p>The prewar price of the oil distilled from the wintergreen plant as quoted in
the wholesale drug markets generally ranged from $3 to $5 a pound. Recently
the lack of labor has reduced the output of oil, and in consequence the price
has advanced. The oil became practically unobtainable on the markets in
October, 1919, at which time it had reached a price of $11 a pound. Collectors
usually receive from 4 to 5 cents a pound for the dry herb. The results of
numerous trials indicate that, on account of the small yield, wintergreen production
under cultivation is not likely to be profitable at the prices quoted.</p>

<h2><a name="WORMSEED_AMERICAN" id="WORMSEED_AMERICAN">WORMSEED, AMERICAN.</a></h2>


<p>American wormseed, or Jerusalem oak (<i>Chenopodium ambrosioides anthelminticum</i>),
is a coarse weed, occurring commonly in waste places and often
in cultivated ground throughout the eastern and southern parts of the United
States. The seeds (fruits) and the volatile oil distilled from the tops of the
plant are employed in medicine.</p>

<p>This plant grows well under cultivation in almost any soil, but a good sandy
loam is preferred. It is now cultivated for oil production only in a small
area in Carroll County, Md. The seed is sown in well-prepared beds about
March 1, and between May 15 and June 15, when the seedlings are 4 to 5
inches tall, they are transplanted and set about 10 inches apart in rows about
3 feet apart. The soil is kept entirely free from weeds by shallow cultivation
throughout the growing season.</p>

<p>Harvesting is usually begun early in September or as soon as the seeds have
taken on a black color, but before the plants have turned brown. If harvesting
is delayed until the plants are fully mature there will be considerable
loss through shattering and a diminution in the yield of oil when they are
distilled. The crop is harvested with large knives or sickles, either by cutting
off the entire plant at the ground or by cutting the branches separately. The
latter method saves the labor of handling a quantity of useless woody material
and also requires a smaller still capacity to handle the crop. After cutting,
the plants are laid out on the ground in rows and allowed to cure for about
three days before they are distilled.</p>

<p>In the South wormseed has been grown successfully as a seed crop. The
ground is prepared in February and laid off in rows about 4 feet apart. A
furrow is opened in each row, in which a complete fertilizer is applied at the
rate of 400 to 500 pounds per acre. The soil on each side of the row is
thrown in with a turnplow, forming a low ridge, which is then flattened with a
light roller. The seeds are sown on this ridge with a drill. The plants are
thinned to stand 18 inches apart in the row and are given frequent shallow
cultivation.</p>

<p>The crop should be ready for harvesting late in July or early in August and
should be cut before the tops begin to take on a brown color. The plants are
cut either with a mower or old-style grain reaper and are left in the field
until thoroughly dry. They may be housed and the seed thrashed out when
convenient, but, since the seeds shatter easily, waste will be avoided if the
plants are thrown upon large canvas sheets and the seed thrashed out in the
field. The seed is light and not easily cleaned, but wire sieves of suitable mesh
have proved very satisfactory for this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"> 50 </a></span></p>

<p>The yield of seed per acre averages about 1,000 pounds. The yield of oil
varies, but under favorable conditions about 40 pounds per acre is regarded
as a fair average. The area planted varies according to the price of the oil
and may range from 175 to 450 acres. The average annual production of oil
is estimated by producers to be 10,000 to 12,000 pounds.</p>

<p>The prewar price of wormseed ranged from 6 to 8 cents a pound. The price
in June, 1920, was about 15 cents a pound. The prewar price of the oil ranged
from $1.40 to $5.50 a pound. The price in June, 1920, was $9 to $9.50 a
pound.</p>

and now occurs as a weed in many localities in the southern part of the United
States. For many years it has been grown commercially on a small scale,
chiefly in Michigan and Wisconsin. The dried leaves and tops have long been
used medicinally, but the volatile oil distilled from the plant now forms the
principal marketable product.</p>

<p>Wormwood will grow in almost any soil, but the best results are to be
expected in deep, rich, moderately moist loams. The seeds are frequently sown
broadcast early in the fall, following a grain crop; but if the plants are to be
cultivated, it is best to start them from seeds sown in seed beds early in the
spring or from cuttings of the young shoots taken in the spring and rooted in
sand under glass or in the shade of a lath shed. The seeds are very small and
should be sown on the surface of the soil in coldframes or seed beds and lightly
covered with very fine sandy soil. The plants are easily handled and may be
transplanted in moist weather with good results at almost any time during the
growing season. They are set about 18 inches apart in rows 3 or 4 feet apart
and are well cultivated. The soil should be kept absolutely free from weeds,
since their presence in the crop at harvest time seriously damages the quality
of the oil. A fair cutting of the herb may be expected the first year after planting
and full crops for two or three successive, seasons, after which new plantings
will be found more satisfactory.</p>

<p>The plants are harvested when in full bloom and may be cut with a scythe,
or a reaper may be used if the area is large. While still fresh, the plants are
distilled with steam to obtain the volatile oil. To prepare the leaves and flowering
tops for market they are stripped from the stems by hand after the plants
are cut and carefully dried in the shade without the use of artificial heat.</p>

<p>Experimental plantings have given yields at the rate of 2,000 pounds of dry
tops or 40 pounds of oil per acre. When grown on a commercial scale the yield
of oil appears to average about 20 pounds per acre.</p>

<p>The prewar price of the dry tops was about 6 or 7 cents a pound. Its price
in June, 1920, was 17 to 18 cents a pound. The oil was once used extensively
in the manufacture of absinth, but when the use of this product was
restricted in 1912 the demand for the oil fell off and the price declined, until
in the early part of 1915 it reached the low level of $2 a pound. The price in
June, 1920, was about $13 a pound. The average annual production of oil
of wormwood is about 2,000 pounds. Owing to the limited use of this oil, there
appears to be little room for further profitable expansion of this industry.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
